## Chapter 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering

What is Prompt Engineering? 

Prompt engineering is the process of creating prompts or directing the output of a language model like ChatGPT. It allows users to control the output of the model and generate text that meets their specific needs. 

ChatGPT is an advanced language model capable of generating human-like text. It is built on a Transformer architecture that can process large amounts of data and generate high-quality text. 

However, in order to get the best results from ChatGPT, it is important to understand how to properly prompt the model. Prompts give the user control over the model's output and generate relevant, accurate, and high-quality text. When using ChatGPT, it's important to understand its capabilities and limitations.

The model is capable of generating human-like text, but without proper guidance, it may not always produce the desired output. 

That's where the Prompt project comes in, by providing clear and specific instructions, you can guide the output of your model and make sure it's relevant.

A Prompt formula is a specific format for a prompt, usually consisting of three main elements: 

- Task: Make a clear and concise statement of what the prompt requires the model to generate. 

- Instructions: Instructions that the model should follow when generating text. 

- Role: The role that the model should play when generating text. 

In this book, we'll explore the various Prompt engineering techniques that can be used for ChatGPT. We'll discuss the different types of tips and how you can use them to achieve your specific goals.

## Chapter 2: Instruction Prompting Techniques

Now, let's start exploring the "instruction prompting technique" and how you can use it to generate high-quality text from ChatGPT.

Instruction prompting technology is a method of guiding ChatGPT's output by providing specific instructions to the model. This technique is very useful for ensuring that the output is relevant and of high quality.

To use the instruction prompt technique, you need to provide the model with clear and concise tasks, as well as specific instructions for the model to follow.

For example, if you're generating a customer service response, you'll provide tasks such as instructions to "generate responses to customer inquiries" such as "responses should be professional and provide accurate information."

Prompt formula: "Generate [task] as instructed: [Instruction]"

Example:

Generate Customer Service Responses: 

- Task: Generate responses to customer queries 
- Instructions: Responses should be professional and accurate 
- Prompt formula: "Follow these instructions to generate a professional and accurate response to a customer query: The response should be professional and provide accurate information." ”

Generate legal documents: 

- Task: Generate legal documents 
- Directives: Documents should comply with relevant laws and regulations 
- Prompt formula: "Follow the instructions below to generate a legal document that complies with the relevant laws and regulations: The document should comply with the relevant laws and regulations." ”

When using the instruction prompting technique, it is important to remember that the instructions should be clear and specific. This will help ensure that the output is relevant and of high quality. Instruction prompting techniques can be combined with "role prompts" and "seed word prompts" explained in the next chapter to enhance ChatGPT's output.

<div style="page-break-after:always; "></div>

## Chapter 3: Character Hints

Character hint technology is a way to guide ChatGPT's output by assigning a specific persona. This technique is very useful for generating text that is targeted to a specific context or audience.

To use the character hint technique, you need to provide a clear and specific role for your model.

For example, if you're generating customer service responses, you can provide a role such as Customer Service Representative.

Hint formula: "Generate [task] as [role]" 

Example: 

**Generate customer service responses:** 

- Task: Generate responses to customer queries 
- Role: Customer Service Representative 
- Prompt formula: "As a customer service representative, generate responses to customer inquiries." ”

Generate legal documents: 

- Task: Generate legal documents 
- Role: Lawyer 
- Hint formula: "As a lawyer, generate legal documents." ”

Using role-prompting techniques in conjunction with instruction prompts and seed word prompts can enhance ChatGPT's output.

Here's an example of how to use a combination of instruction hints, role hints, and seed word hints:**

- Task: Generate product descriptions for new smartphones 
- Instructions: Descriptions should be informative, persuasive, and highlight the unique features of the smartphone 
- Role: Marketing Representative Seed Word: "Innovative" 
- Tip formula: "As a market representative, generate an informative and persuasive product description that highlights the innovative features of the new smartphone." The smartphone has the following features [insert your function]"

In this example, the prompt is used to ensure that the product description is informative and persuasive. Persona prompts are used to ensure that descriptions are written from the perspective of a market representative. Seed prompts, on the other hand, are used to ensure that the description focuses on the innovative features of the smartphone.

<div style="page-break-after:always; "></div>

## Chapter 4: Standard Tips

The standard prompt is an easy way to bootstrap ChatGPT's output by providing the model with a specific task. For example, if you want to generate a summary of a news article, you can provide a task such as "Summarize this news article."

Hint formula: "Generate a [task]"

For example: 

Generate a summary of a news article: 

- Task: Summarize this news article 
- Hint formula: "Generate a summary of this news article"

Generate a product review: 

- Task: Write a review for a new smartphone 
- Hint formula: "Generate reviews of this new smartphone"

In addition, standard prompts can be used in conjunction with other techniques, such as character prompts and seed word prompts, to enhance ChatGPT's output.

Here's an example of how to use a combination of standard, role, and seed word techniques: 

- Task: Write a product review for a new laptop 
- Description: Reviews should be objective, informative, and emphasize the unique features of the laptop 
- Role: Technical Specialist 
- Seed word: "powerful" 
- Tip formula: "As a technologist, generate an objective and informative product review that highlights the powerful features of your new laptop." ”

In this example, the standard prompting technique is used to ensure that the model generates product reviews. Role prompts are used to ensure that reviews are written from the perspective of a technical expert. Whereas, seed word prompts are used to ensure that the review focuses on the powerful features of the laptop.

<div style="page-break-after:always; "></div>

## Chapter 5: Zero, One, and Few-Shot Tips

Zero-shot, same-copy, and few-shot prompts are techniques used to generate text from ChatGPT with minimal or no examples. These techniques are useful when there is limited data for a particular task or when the task is new and undefined.

When there are no examples available for the task, the zero-shot prompt technique is used. The model provides a generic task that generates text based on an understanding of the task. 

Use the same hint technique when only one example is available for the task. The model provides examples and generates text based on an understanding of the examples. 

Use few-shot prompts when only a limited number of examples are available for the task. The model provides examples and generates text based on an understanding of the examples. 

Prompt formula: "Generate text based on [number] of examples" 

For example: 

Write a product description for a new product for which there are no examples available: 

- Task: Write a product description for a new smartwatch 

- Hint formula: "Generate a product description for this new smartwatch based on zero examples" 

Generate a product comparison using one example: 

- Task: Compare the new smartphone with the latest iPhone 

- Prompt formula: "Use one example (latest iPhone) to generate a product comparison for this new smartphone" 

Generate product reviews with a handful of examples: 

- Task: Write a review for a new e-reader 

- Hint formula: "Use a small number of examples (3 other e-readers) to generate reviews for this new e-reader" 


These techniques can be used to generate text based on the model's understanding of the task or the examples provided.

<div style="page-break-after:always; "></div>

## Chapter 6: "Let's Think for a Moment" prompt

The "Let's Think" prompt is a technique that encourages ChatGPT to generate reflective and thought-provoking text. This technique is suitable for tasks such as writing essays, poems, or creative writing. 

The formula for the "Let's Think" prompt is very simple, i.e., "Let's Think" followed by a topic or question. 

For example: 

Generate a Reflective Essay:

- Prompt formula: "Let's Think About It: Personal Growth" 

Generate a poem: 

- Task: Write a poem about the changing of the seasons 

- Prompt formula: "Let's Think: Seasonal Changes" 


This prompt calls for a conversation or discussion about a specific topic or idea. The speaker invited ChatGPT to participate in the discussion of related topics. 

The model provides a prompt that serves as a starting point for conversation or text generation. 

The model then uses its training data and algorithm to generate prompt-related responses. This technique allows ChatGPT to generate contextually appropriate and coherent text based on the prompts provided. 

To use the "Let's Think About Prompts" technique with ChatGPT, you can follow these steps:** 

1. Identify the topic or idea you want to discuss. 

2. Develop a prompt that clearly expresses the topic or idea and start a conversation or text generation. 

3. Prompts that start with "Let's think" or "Let's discuss" indicate that you're starting a conversation or discussion. 

Here are some examples of tips for using this technique: 

- Tip: "Let's think about the impact of climate change on agriculture" 

- Prompt: "Let's discuss the current state of artificial intelligence" 

- Tip: "Let's talk about the benefits and disadvantages of remote work" You can also add an open-ended question, statement, or a paragraph of text that you want the model to continue or expand on. 


Once the prompt is provided, the model uses its training data and algorithm to generate a response related to the prompt and continue the conversation in a coherent manner. 

This unique hint helps ChatGPT give answers from different perspectives and angles, resulting in more dynamic and informative paragraphs. 

The steps to use the hints are simple and easy to follow and can really improve your writing. Give it a try and see how it goes.

Sentiment analysis is a technique that allows models to determine the emotional color or attitude of a text, such as whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.

To use sentiment analysis prompts in ChatGPT, the model should provide a piece of text and ask for classification based on its sentiment.

The prompt should also include information about the desired output, such as the type of emotion to be detected (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) and any specific requirements or constraints.

Example of a hint and its formula:

**Example 1: Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews**

- Task: Determine the sentiment of customer reviews
- Description: The model should classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral
- Tip formula: "Perform sentiment analysis [insert review] on the following customer reviews and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral." ”

**Example 2: Sentiment Analysis of Tweets**

- Task: Determine the sentiment of a tweet
- Description: The model should classify Tweets as positive, negative, or neutral
- Hint formula: "Perform sentiment analysis [insert tweets] on the following Tweets and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral." ”

**Example 3: Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews**

- Task: Determine the sentiment of a product review
- Description: The model should classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral
- Prompt formula: "Perform sentiment analysis [insert review] on the following product reviews and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral." ”

This technique is useful for tasks such as natural language processing, customer service, and market research.

## Chapter 22: Named Entity Recognition Tips

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a technique that enables models to recognize and classify named entities in text, such as people's names, organizations, places, and dates.

To use named entity recognition hints in ChatGPT, the model needs to be provided with a piece of text and asked to recognize and classify named entities in the text.

The prompt should also include information about the desired output, such as the type of named entity to be identified (e.g., person's name, organization, location, date) and any specific requirements or constraints.

Example of a hint and its formula:

**Example 1: Named Entity Recognition in a News Article** 

- Task: Identify and classify named entities in news articles 
- Description: The model should identify and classify names, organizations, places, and dates 
- Prompt formula: "Perform named entity recognition on the following news articles [insert article] and identify and classify people's names, organizations, places, and dates." ”

**Example 2: Named Entity Recognition in Legal Documents** 

- Task: Identify and classify named entities in legal documents 
- Description: The model should identify and classify names, organizations, places, and dates 
- Prompt formula: "Perform named entity identification on the following legal document [insert file] and identify and classify the person's name, organization, place, and date." ”

**Example 3: Named Entity Recognition in a Research Paper** 

- Task: Identify and classify named entities in a research paper 
- Description: The model should identify and classify names, organizations, places, and dates 
- Prompt formula: "Perform named entity recognition on the following research paper [insert paper] and identify and classify people's names, organizations, places, and dates." ”

## Chapter Twenty-Three: Text Classification Tips

Text classification is a technique that allows models to divide text into different categories. This technique is useful for tasks such as natural language processing, text analysis, and sentiment analysis.

It is important to note that text classification and sentiment analysis are different. Sentiment analysis is particularly concerned with determining the emotion or sentiment expressed in a text. This may include determining whether the text expresses positive, negative, or neutral emotions. Sentiment analysis is often used for customer reviews, social media posts, and other texts that need to express emotion.

To use text classification prompts in ChatGPT, the model needs to provide a piece of text and ask it to classify it according to a predefined category or tag. The prompt should also include information about the desired output, such as the number of categories or labels and any specific requirements or constraints.

Example of a hint and its formula:

**Example 1: Text Classification of Customer Reviews** 

- Tasks: Categorize customer reviews into different categories, such as electronics, clothing, and furniture 
- Description: Models should be categorized based on the content of the reviews 
- Tip formula: "Textually categorize the following customer reviews [insert review] and categorize them into different categories based on their content, such as electronics, clothing, and furniture." ”

**Example 2: Text classification of news articles** 

- Task: Categorize news articles into different categories, such as sports, politics, and entertainment 
- Description: Models should classify articles based on their content 
- Hint formula: "Textually classify the following news articles [insert articles] and classify them into different categories based on their content, such as sports, politics, and entertainment." ”

**Example 3: Text Classification of Emails** 

- Tasks: Categorize emails into different categories, such as spam, important, or urgent 
- Description: The model should classify emails based on their content and sender 
- Prompt formula: "Textually classify the following emails [insert email] and classify them into different categories based on their content and sender, such as spam, important, or urgent." ”

## Chapter Twenty-Four: Text Generation Prompts

Text generation prompts are related to other prompting techniques mentioned in this book, such as: zero, one, and several prompts, controlled generation prompts, translation prompts, language modeling prompts, sentence completion prompts, etc. These tips are all related to generating text, but they differ in how the text is generated and the specific requirements or limitations placed on the generated text. Text generation prompts can be used to fine-tune a pretrained model or train a new model to perform a specific task.

Example of a hint and its formula: 

**Example 1: Text Generation for Story Authoring** 

- Quest: Generate a story based on the given prompts 
- Description: The story should be at least 1000 words long and include a specific set of characters and plot. 
- Hint formula: "Generate a story with at least 1000 words, including characters [insert character] and plot [insert plot] based on the following hint [insert hint]." ”

**Example 2: Text Generation for Language Translation** 

- Task: Translate a given text into another language 
- Description: Translations should be accurate and conform to idiomatic expressions. 
- Prompt formula: "Translate the following text [insert text] into [insert target language] and make sure it is accurate and conforms to idioms." ”

**Example 3: Text Generation for Text Completion** 

- Task: Complete the given text 
- Description: The generated text should be consistent with the entered text. 
- Prompt formula: "Complete the following text [Insert text] and make sure it's coherent and consistent with the entered text." ”

(This article is translated from the book "The Art of Asking ChatGPT for High-Quality Answers A Complete Guide to Prompt Engineering Techniques", and the translation of this article is all done by ChatGpt, and I just typeset the translated content a little.) When I finished it, I realized that someone had already done this work... The following is a short story that I asked New Bing to write based on this incident, I hope you like it)

> He finally finished his painting and hung it on the wall with satisfaction. He felt that it was the greatest work of his life, unsurpassed. He invited all his friends to admire and look forward to their praise and amazement. But when they saw the painting, no one spoke. They just look at each other and then look down and cough, or pretend to look at their phones. He wondered, didn't they all understand art? Don't they have vision? He couldn't help but ask one of his friends, "What do you think of my paintings?" The friend hesitated for a moment and said, "Hmm...... In fact...... This painting ...... Where have I seen it before. "Seen? Where have you seen it? He asked, surprised. "It's ...... It's over there. My friend pointed to a small frame in the corner, "Isn't that the famous painting you bought last month?" How did you copy it?                                                             ——New Bing

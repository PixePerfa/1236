## ClassDef MinxChatOpenAI
**MinxChatOpenAI**: The function of the MinxChatOpenAI class is to provide a method to interact with the tiktoken library, which is used to import the tiktoken library and obtain the coding model. 

**Attributes**:
This class of functions is primarily implemented through static methods and does not directly use properties to store data. 

**Code Description**:
The MinxChatOpenAI class contains two static methods:`import_tiktoken` and`get_encoding_model`. 

- `import_tiktoken`The method tries to import `tiktoken`the package, and if the import fails, an exception is thrown `ValueError`to prompt the user that it needs to be installed`tiktoken`. This is to ensure that subsequent operations can use`tiktoken` the functionality provided by the package. 

- `get_encoding_model`The method is responsible for getting the corresponding coded model based on the model name. It first tries to`tiktoken` get the encoded information of the specified model from the library. If the model name is`gpt-3.5-turbo` OR`gpt-4`, the method is automatically adjusted to the corresponding specific version to accommodate possible updates to the model. If the specified model`tiktoken` is not found in the library, the default `cl100k_base`encoding model is used and a warning message is logged. 

In a project,`MinxChatOpenAI` a class's `get_encoding_model`methods are called by `get_ChatOpenAI`functions to configure and initialize`ChatOpenAI` instances. This suggests that `MinxChatOpenAI`the function provided by the class is to get the `ChatOpenAI`correct coding model for the instance, which is critical for processing and understanding the conversation. 

**Note**:
- Before using `MinxChatOpenAI`classes, make sure that you have installed the `tiktoken`package, otherwise you will not be able to import and use it successfully. 
- When calling `get_encoding_model`a method, you need to pay attention to whether the model name passed in is correct and that you are ready to handle possible exceptions and warnings. 

**Example output**:
`get_encoding_model`An example output that might be returned by calling a method is:
```python
("gpt-3.5-turbo-0301", <tiktoken.Encoding object at 0x123456789>)
```
This means that the method returns the model name and the corresponding encoded object.
### FunctionDef import_tiktoken
**import_tiktoken**: The function of this function is to import the tiktoken library. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code Description**: `import_tiktoken` The function attempts to import  a `tiktoken` Python package. If the import fails, i.e. the `tiktoken` package is not installed in the environment, the function throws an `ImportError` exception. In order to provide a clear error message to the user, the function catches this exception and throws a new `ValueError` , prompting the user that the package needs to be installed `tiktoken` to compute.`get_token_ids` This function is `MinxChatOpenAI` part of the class and is mainly used to `tiktoken` ensure that the library has been imported when you need to use the function. In a project, it`import_tiktoken` is `get_encoding_model` called by a method that is used to get the encoded information for a particular model. This suggests that `tiktoken` libraries play a key role in handling model coding. 

In the `get_encoding_model` method, `import_tiktoken` first make sure that  the `tiktoken` library is available by calling the function. Then, the corresponding encoding information is obtained based on the model name (`self.tiktoken_model_name` or `self.model_name`). If the specified model name is not supported, the default encoding model will be used. This process demonstrates `import_tiktoken` practical application in a project, i.e. as a necessary step before obtaining model coding. 

**Note**: Before using this function, make sure that you have installed the `tiktoken` package. If you don't have one, you can install it by running `pip install tiktoken` . In addition, when  a `tiktoken` package import fails, the function will throw a  message `ValueError`indicating that the package needs to be installed. Developers should take care to catch and handle this exception properly to avoid crashing when the package is not installed `tiktoken` . 

**Example of output**: Since the purpose of this function is to import `tiktoken` packages, it does not return data directly. When executed successfully, it returns `tiktoken` a  module object, allowing subsequent code to call `tiktoken` the functionality of . For example, after a successful import, you can use `tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model_name)` to  get the encoded information for a specified model.

### FunctionDef get_encoding_model(self)
**get_encoding_model**: The function of this function is to obtain the encoded information of the specified model. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code Description**: `get_encoding_model` The method first attempts to `import_tiktoken` import the  library by calling `tiktoken` a function to ensure that subsequent operations can use the `tiktoken` functionality provided. Next, the name of the `self.tiktoken_model_name` `self.model_name` model for which the encoded information needs to be obtained is determined based on the instance variable or . If `self.tiktoken_model_name` it is not , `None`the value is used directly; Otherwise, use the `self.model_name`. For a specific model name, such as "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-4", the method internally converts it to a specific version name to accommodate situations where the model may be updated over time. After that, try to `tiktoken_.encoding_for_model(model)` get the encoded information for the specified model using the Get. If an exception occurs during this process (e.g., a model name is not supported), the exception is captured and a warning message is logged, using the default coding model "cl100k_base". Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the model name and encoding information. 

**Note**: Before using `get_encoding_model` the method, make sure that you have installed the `tiktoken` package. If you `tiktoken` encounter a problem when  trying to import , an exception will be thrown `ValueError` indicating that the package needs to be installed `tiktoken` . In addition, when the specified model name is not supported, the method defaults to the "cl100k_base" encoding model and logs a warning message. 

**Example output**: Assuming the method is called `get_encoding_model` and the specified model name is correctly recognized, the possible return value is:

```python
("gpt-3.5-turbo-0301", <tiktoken.Encoding 对象>)
```

The first element returned is the model name, and the second element is the encoded information object corresponding to the model. If the model name is not supported, the return value might be:

```python
("cl100k_base", <tiktoken.Encoding 对象>)
```

This indicates that the method uses the default coding model "cl100k_base".

## ClassDef DefaultKBService
**DefaultKBService**: The DefaultKBService class is used to provide a default knowledge base service implementation. 

**Attributes**:
This class inherits from KBService, so it inherits all the properties of KBService, including the knowledge base name (kb_name), knowledge base information (kb_info), embedding model name (embed_model), knowledge base path (kb_path), and document path (doc_path), among others. 

**Code Description**:
The DefaultKBService class is an implementation of KBService, which provides basic operations on the knowledge base, including methods such as creating a knowledge base, deleting a knowledge base, adding documents to the knowledge base, emptying the knowledge base, obtaining the knowledge base type, initializing the knowledge base, searching the knowledge base, inserting knowledge in batches, inserting knowledge individually, and deleting documents. Most of these methods exist in the form of null methods (passes) in DefaultKBService, which means that the functionality of these methods needs to be implemented by subclasses that inherit from DefaultKBService. 

DefaultKBService ensures the same interface as other KB service implementations by inheriting from the KBService class, and the purpose of this is to provide a default KB service implementation that can be used when a specific KB service type is not specified.

**Note**:
- Most of the methods of the DefaultKBService class itself are not implemented concretely (using passes), and you need to extend this class and override these methods to provide specific functionality.
- When using DefaultKBService or its subclasses, you need to ensure that the relevant information of the knowledge base, such as the knowledge base name, embedding model name, etc., has been correctly configured.
- Instantiation of the DefaultKBService class is usually done dynamically by the get_service method of the KBServiceFactory class based on the configuration, rather than instantiating directly in code.

**Example output**:
Since the methods of the DefaultKBService class are mostly not concretely implemented, there is no direct output example. The exact output will depend on the subclasses that inherit DefaultKBService and the methods implemented by those subclasses. For example, if a subclass implements do_search method, an example of the output of a search document might look like this:
```python
[
    {"id": "doc1", "text": "文档1的内容", "score": 0.95},
    {"id": "doc2", "text": "文档2的内容", "score": 0.90}
]
```
This means that when the search operation is performed, two documents and their relevance scores are returned.
### FunctionDef do_create_kb(self)
**do_create_kb**: The function of this function is to create a knowledge base. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code Description**: `do_create_kb` A function is a `DefaultKBService` method of a class that aims to create a knowledge base. In the current code implementation, this function body is empty, which means that it has not yet implemented a specific function. In practice, developers need to add logic to this function to create a knowledge base, such as initializing the structure of the knowledge base, storing the data of the knowledge base, or configuring the related settings of the knowledge base. This function exists as a framework or placeholder for future extensions and implementations. 

**Note**: When using this function, you need to be aware of the following:
- Since the current function body is empty, calling this function directly has no effect. Developers need to implement the logic of creating a knowledge base according to specific needs.
- When implementing function logic, factors such as the security, scalability, and performance of the knowledge base should be considered to ensure the stable and efficient operation of the knowledge base.
- If there are already existing knowledge base services or frameworks in the project, developers should evaluate whether to use or extend the existing services directly to avoid duplication of effort and improve development efficiency.

### FunctionDef do_drop_kb(self)
**do_drop_kb**: The function of this function is to delete the knowledge base. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code Description**: `do_drop_kb` A function is `DefaultKBService` a method of the class that implements the deletion of a knowledge base. In the current code implementation, this function body is empty (using  a `pass` statement), which means it is not doing anything. In practice, developers need to add logic to this function to implement specific deletion operations of the knowledge base, such as deleting the data related to the knowledge base from the database or cleaning up the resources used by the knowledge base. 

**Note**: Although the current implementation is empty, developers should be aware when using this function that deleting the knowledge base is an important operation that may have an irreversible impact on the data stored in the system. Therefore, when implementing and calling this function, you should ensure that you have adequate permission checks and the necessary data backup mechanisms in place to prevent data loss or accidental deletion. In addition, given the sensitive nature of the operation, it may be necessary to implement appropriate logging capabilities to facilitate problem tracking and auditing. 
***
### FunctionDef do_add_doc(self, docs)
**do_add_doc**: The function of this function is to add documents to the knowledge base. 

**Parameters**:
- `docs`: A list of documents that need to be added to the knowledge base, of type`List[Document]`. 

**Code Description**:
`do_add_doc`A function is `DefaultKBService`a method of a class that is designed to implement the ability to add a series of documents(`docs`s) to the knowledge base. The method accepts a parameter`docs`, which is a `Document`list of objects. Each `Document`object represents a document that needs to be added to the knowledge base. 

In the current code implementation, the `do_add_doc`specific logic of the method has not yet been implemented, and only the framework for the definition of the method and the reception of parameters is provided. This means that if you need to use this method to add documents to the knowledge base, you need to implement the specific logic for adding documents to the knowledge base on top of that. 

**Note**:
- Before actually using `do_add_doc`the method, you need to make sure that each `Document`object has been constructed correctly and contains all the necessary information to be successfully added to the knowledge base. 
- Since the current implementation is empty, calling this method won't have any practical effect until you implement the specific logic for adding documentation to the knowledge base.
- When implementing specific logic, you need to consider how to handle exceptions that may occur during the document addition process, such as the document is incorrectly formatted or fails to be added to the knowledge base.
***
### FunctionDef do_clear_vs(self)
**do_clear_vs**: The function of this function is to clear the view state. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code description**: `do_clear_vs`A function is `DefaultKBService`a member method of a class that currently has an empty internal implementation, i.e. it does nothing when it is called. In a `DefaultKBService`class, this method may be designed to clear or reset some view state related to the knowledge base service, but specific implementation details have not yet been provided. This design is often used to reset the state of a service when needed, or to clean up resources after certain operations are complete. 

**Note**: While `do_clear_vs`the implementation of the current method is empty, developers should be aware of possible future updates or implementations when using this method. Before calling this method, it is recommended to check the relevant documentation or changelog to understand its latest features and how to use it. Also, since the method doesn't do anything at the moment, developers should avoid calling it unnecessarily in production to avoid introducing potential side effects or performance issues in future releases. 
***
### FunctionDef vs_type(self)
**vs_type function function**: Returns the type of the current knowledge base service. 

****Arguments: This function does not accept any arguments. 

**Code Description**: `vs_type`A function is `DefaultKBService`a method of a class that identifies the type of knowledge base service currently in use. In this context, it is designed to return a string value`"default"`, meaning that the default knowledge base service type will be used if not specifically specified. This design allows for the flexibility to specify and use different service types when there may be multiple knowledge base service types in the system. By returning an explicit string identifier, the rest of the system can decide how to interact with the knowledge base service based on that identifier. 

**Note**: When using `vs_type`a method, you need to pay attention to how it works with the logic of other parts of the system. Because it returns a fixed string value, you may need to update this method to reflect the new service type if the system expands to include more knowledge base service types. 

**Example output**: 
```python
"default"
```
This output example shows the `vs_type`return value that you will receive when you call a method. In the current implementation, each call to this method returns a string`"default"`, indicating that the default knowledge base service type is used. 
***
### FunctionDef do_init(self)
**do_init**: The function of this function is to initialize an instance of the DefaultKBService class. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code description**: `do_init`A function is `DefaultKBService`a method in a class that currently has an empty internal implementation, i.e. it does not perform any action. This usually means that the method is reserved for future extensions, or as part of an interface, and the specific implementation will be done in a subclass. In object-oriented programming, such a design allows developers to extend functionality by inheriting and rewriting methods without modifying existing code. 

**Note**: Although the current `do_init`method does not perform any operations, in future development, if you need to `DefaultKBService`initialize the instance of the class, such as the loading of configuration parameters, the allocation of resources, etc., you can implement this method in this method. Therefore, when using`DefaultKBService` classes, developers should be aware that `do_init`methods may contain important initialization logic in the future, and should be called after the instance is created to ensure that the object is initialized correctly. 
***
### FunctionDef do_search(self)
**do_search**: The function of this function is to perform a search operation. 

**Parameters**: This function does not currently have any parameters defined. 

**Code Description**: `do_search` A function is a `DefaultKBService` member method of a class that is designed to implement search functionality. According to the implementation of the function body, this function body is currently empty, that is, it is not doing anything. This usually means that the function is a stub to be implemented, reserved for developers to implement search logic based on their specific needs. In practice, developers may need to populate this function body according to specific search needs, such as keyword search, fuzzy search, or other advanced search functions. For example, you can implement specific search logic by querying a database, invoking an external search service, or applying a search algorithm. 

**Note**: While the current `do_search` function doesn't implement any specific logic, in future development, developers should make sure to add the appropriate parameters and return values to it to meet the needs of the search function. In addition, considering that performance and accuracy are key to search functionality, attention should be paid to optimizing the search algorithm and the ability to process large amounts of data when developing. Before implementing the specific logic, it is recommended to define the input and output specifications of the function, as well as the error handling mechanisms that may be involved. 
***
### FunctionDef do_insert_multi_knowledge(self)
**do_insert_multi_knowledge**: The function of this function is to insert multiple pieces of knowledge data in batches. 

**Parameters**: This function does not currently accept any parameters. 

**Code Description**:  A `do_insert_multi_knowledge` function is `DefaultKBService` a method of the class designed to handle operations that are inserted into knowledge data in batches. Currently, the implementation of the function is empty (using  a `pass` statement), which means that it has not yet implemented a specific function. In future development, this function may be extended to accept parameters, such as a list of knowledge data, and insert these data into the knowledge base in bulk. This bulk insert operation is often more efficient than a single insert, especially when large amounts of data need to be added to the knowledge base. 

**Note**: 
- Since `do_insert_multi_knowledge` the implementation of the current function is empty, calling this function has no effect. Developers need to implement specific insertion logic before using this function. 
- When implementing batch insertion logic, data consistency and transaction management need to be taken into account to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data.
- Developers should take performance optimizations into account when extending this function to implement specific features, such as using batch processing techniques to reduce the number of database accesses and improve data insertion efficiency.
- This function may be updated in the future to accept parameters and return values, and developers should pay attention to the relevant documentation when using it for proper use.
***
### FunctionDef do_insert_one_knowledge(self)
**do_insert_one_knowledge**: The function of this function is to insert a single knowledge record. 

**Parameters**: This function does not currently accept any parameters. 

**Code Description**:  A `do_insert_one_knowledge` function is `DefaultKBService` a member method of a class that is designed to insert a new knowledge record into the knowledge base. The current version of the function body is empty, which means that it has not yet implemented specific insertion logic. In a future release, this function may be extended to include code that interacts with the database to actually insert knowledge records into the back-end storage system. This can involve operations such as constructing database queries, working with data models, and managing database connections and transactions. 

**Note**: 
- Since the current function body is empty, calling this function has no effect. Developers need to pay attention to the implementation status of this function when using it, and avoid using unfinished functions directly in the production environment.
- In future implementations, developers may need to pay attention to the design of function parameters so that they can flexibly pass the knowledge record data to be inserted.
- In addition, considering the consistency and integrity of the data, it may be necessary to handle errors and anomalies when implementing this feature to ensure the correct insertion of knowledge records.
***
### FunctionDef do_delete_doc(self)
**do_delete_doc**: The function of this function is to delete the document. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code description**:  A `do_delete_doc` function is `DefaultKBService` a method of a class that currently has an empty internal implementation, i.e. there is no execution code in the function body. This usually means that the method is a feature placeholder to be implemented, or that the specific logic for deleting the document has not been defined in the current version of the code. In object-oriented programming, this practice is often used to define interfaces or abstract classes, with methods reserved for subclasses to implement specific functions. However, based on the context in which this function is located – the class located in`default_kb_service.py` the file`DefaultKBService`, we can infer that `do_delete_doc`the method is intended to provide a function for deleting a specific document in the knowledge base. In a future release, developers may add code to this method to implement the logic of deleting a specific document from the database or storage system. 

**Note**: While `do_delete_doc`the implementation of the current method is empty, developers should ensure that they understand its intended functionality and implementation logic before using this method. If you're`DefaultKBService` a developer responsible for extending or maintaining classes, you`do_delete_doc`'ll need to consider how to safely and efficiently remove data from your knowledge base service when implementing your approach, including handling possible dependencies and ensuring data consistency. In addition, given the importance of data, deletion should be implemented with adequate error handling and logging to track and recover accidentally deleted data.

## ClassDef FaissKBService
**FaissKBService**: The FaissKBService class is a concrete class used to implement knowledge base services through FAISS. 

**Properties**:
- `vs_path`: Vector storage path.
- `kb_path`: Knowledge base path.
- `vector_name`: The name of the vector, which defaults to None.

**Code Description**:
The FaissKBService class inherits from the KBService class and is specifically designed to handle FAISS-based vector search services. It provides a range of ways to manage and operate the FAISS knowledge base, including the creation, deletion, addition, deletion and search of documents. 

- `vs_type` The method returns a supported vector storage type, i.e., FAISS.
- `get_vs_path` The and `get_kb_path` methods are used to obtain the vector storage path and the knowledge base path, respectively. 
- `load_vector_store` method loads the vector store and returns a thread-safe FAISS instance.
- `save_vector_store` The method saves the vector store to the specified path.
- `get_doc_by_ids` The method gets the document based on the document ID.
- `del_doc_by_ids` Method: Deletes a document based on its ID.
- `do_init` The method sets the vector name, knowledge base path, and vector storage path when the class is initialized.
- `do_create_kb` method creates a knowledge base, and if the vector storage path does not exist, it creates the path.
- `do_drop_kb` Methods to delete a knowledge base, including clearing vector storage and deleting a knowledge base path.
- `do_search` The method implements the FAISS-based document search function.
- `do_add_doc` method adds documents to the knowledge base and converts them into vector storage.
- `do_delete_doc` The method deletes the specified document from the knowledge base.
- `do_clear_vs` method clears everything in the vector store.
- `exist_doc` Method checks whether a document with the specified file name exists.

**Note**:
- Before using the FaissKBService class, you need to ensure that your FAISS environment is properly installed and configured.
- When you call `do_add_doc` methods such as , , and`do_delete_doc` modify the content of the knowledge base, you should pay attention to the atomicity and thread safety of the operation. 
- `do_search` The parameter in the method `score_threshold` is used to filter the search results to return only documents that score above this threshold. 

**Example output**:
```python
# 假设执行搜索操作，返回两个文档及其相关性得分
[
    (Document(id="doc1", text="文档1的内容"), 0.95),
    (Document(id="doc2", text="文档2的内容"), 0.90)
]
```
This means that when the search operation is performed, two documents and their relevance scores are returned.
### FunctionDef vs_type(self)
**vs_type**: The function of vs_type is to return the type of vector store used by the current knowledge base service. 

****Arguments: This function does not accept any arguments. 

**Code Description**: The vs_type function is a method of the FaissKBService class, and its main function is to identify the vector storage type used by the FaissKBService class instance. In this concrete implementation, the vs_type method explicitly states that FaissKBService uses FAISS as its vector storage service by returning SupportedVSType.FAISS. SupportedVSType is an enumeration class that defines all vector storage types supported by the project, including but not limited to FAISS, MILVUS, ZILLIZ, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and ChromaDB. By returning SupportedVSType.FAISS, the vs_type method enables the KBServiceFactory to recognize and instantiate the FaissKBService as a concrete implementation of the vector storage service. This design allows the project to dynamically select different vector storage service implementations based on configuration or needs, enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the project. 

**Note**:
- When using the vs_type method, you don't need to pass any arguments, and the method will directly return the vector storage type supported by FaissKBService.
- The return value of the method should be consistent with the vector store type defined in SupportedVSType to ensure that the knowledge base service factory can correctly identify and instantiate the corresponding service.
- When extending your project to support a new vector store service, you should add new types to the SupportedVSType enumeration class and ensure that the corresponding knowledge base service class implements vs_type method that returns the vector store types it supports.

**Example output**: 
```python
'faiss'
```
In this example, the vs_type method returns a string 'faiss', indicating that FaissKBService uses FAISS as its vector storage service.
***
### FunctionDef get_vs_path(self)
**get_vs_path**: The function of this function is to get the vector storage path. 

**Parameter**: This function has no explicit arguments and relies on the internal state of the object. 

**Code Description**: `get_vs_path` A function is `FaissKBService` a method of the class that gets the path to the vector storage. It is achieved by calling a global `get_vs_path` function that requires two parameters:`kb_name` and `vector_name`. These two parameters represent the name of the knowledge base and the name of the vector, respectively, which are `FaissKBService` properties of the object. This means that when  the `get_vs_path` method is called, it takes the knowledge base name and vector name of the current object as arguments to get the path where the vector is stored. 

In a project,`get_vs_path` a method is called by `do_init` a  method. In the `do_init` method, the  sum  is `vector_name` first set through a series of initialization operations`kb_path`, and then the  method `get_vs_path` is called to get the path to the vector store and store it in the `vs_path` property. This suggests that `get_vs_path` the method is a critical step in the object initialization process to determine where the vector is stored. 

**Note**: When using this function, make sure that `kb_name` the  and `vector_name` properties are set correctly, as these two properties directly affect the results of the vector storage path. 

**Example output**: Assuming the knowledge base name is "my_kb" and the vector name is "my_vector", an example of a path that this function might return is "/path/to/my_kb/my_vector_storage". 
***
### FunctionDef get_kb_path(self)
**get_kb_path**: The function of this function is to get the path to the knowledge base. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code Description**: `get_kb_path`A function is `FaissKBService`a method of a class that returns the path to a knowledge base file. It does this by calling`get_kb_path` a function and passing `self.kb_name`it in as an argument. This is`self.kb_name` `FaissKBService`defined during the instantiation of the class and represents the name of the knowledge base. This approach is designed to provide a flexible way to get the path to the knowledge base file, which is critical for storing and accessing the knowledge base. 

In a project, `get_kb_path`methods are called by`do_init` methods. In the`do_init` method, first get `self.get_kb_path()`the knowledge base path and assign a value to `self.kb_path`it, and then proceed to get the vector storage path and assign a value to`self.vs_path` it. This shows that`get_kb_path` the method plays a `FaissKBService`key role in the initialization process of the class, which ensures that the knowledge base path is set correctly, thus providing the basis for subsequent knowledge base operations. 

**Note**: `get_kb_path`When using methods, you need to make sure that they `self.kb_name`have been correctly assigned, as this directly affects the acquisition of the knowledge base path. Also, make sure that the environment in which this method is called has the corresponding`get_kb_path` function definition, and that the incoming knowledge base name parameter is handled correctly. 

**Example of output**: Assuming `self.kb_name`a value of "example_kb", an `get_kb_path`example of the path that the method might return is`"/path/to/knowledge_bases/example_kb"`. This return value represents the specific path where the knowledge base file is stored. 
***
### FunctionDef load_vector_store(self)
**load_vector_store**: The function of this function is to load and return a thread-safe instance of the FAISS vector library. 

**Parameter**: This function has no explicit arguments, it accesses`self` the properties of the class instance. 

**Code Description**: `load_vector_store`The function `kb_faiss_pool.load_vector_store`loads a FAISS vector library by calling methods. It passes three parameters:`kb_name` , `vector_name`, and these `embed_model`parameters represent the name of the knowledge base, the name of the vector, and the embedding model. These parameters are properties `FaissKBService`of the class instance and are used to specify which vector library to load and which embedding model to use. The loaded vector library is an`ThreadSafeFaiss` instance, which ensures that the operation of the FAISS vector library is safe in a multi-threaded environment. 

**Note**:
- Before using this function, make sure that`kb_name` the ,`vector_name` and `embed_model`properties are set correctly, as they determine which vector library will be loaded. 
- The returned `ThreadSafeFaiss`instance supports thread-safe operations, including adding, deleting, and searching documents, and is suitable for multi-threaded environments. 

**Example output**: Assuming`kb_name` "my_kb", `vector_name`"my_vector", "`embed_model`bert", this function might return an instance that represents the following`ThreadSafeFaiss`:
```
<ThreadSafeFaiss: key: my_kb_my_vector, obj: <FAISS向量库对象>, docs_count: 100>
```
This means loading a FAISS vector library called "my_kb_my_vector" with 100 documents.

In a project, `load_vector_store`a function is called by multiple methods, including`save_vector_store` ,`get_doc_by_ids` ,`del_doc_by_ids``do_create_kb``do_search``do_add_doc``do_delete_doc` These methods use `load_vector_store`the loaded vector library to perform various operations, such as saving the vector library to disk, getting documents by ID, deleting documents with specified IDs, creating knowledge bases, performing searches, adding documents, and deleting documents. This represents`load_vector_store` a `FaissKBService`central role in the class and provides the basis for managing and manipulating the FAISS vector library. 
***
### FunctionDef save_vector_store(self)
**save_vector_store**: The function of this function is to save the currently loaded vector library to disk. 

****Arguments: This function has no explicit arguments. 

**Code Description**: `save_vector_store`The method first calls `load_vector_store`the method to load the current vector library, ensuring that the vector library for operations is up-to-date. The loaded vector library is a thread-safe instance of the FAISS vector library, which is guaranteed by the`load_vector_store` method. Once the load is complete,`save` save it to the`self.vs_path` specified path by calling the methods of the vector library instance. This path is `FaissKBService`determined when the class is instantiated and represents where the vector library is stored on disk. 

In the process of saving the vector library, the `save`method checks if the target path exists, and if it does not exist and its `create_path`parameter is True (the default), it creates the path. This process ensures that the vector library is successfully saved even if the target path has not been created before. After the save operation is completed, the relevant information stored in the vector library is recorded in the log, including the key value of the vector library and the saved destination path. 

**Note**:
- Before calling the`save_vector_store` method, make sure it`self.vs_path`'s set up correctly, as it determines which path the vector library will be saved to. 
- Since `save_vector_store`methods depend on `load_vector_store`loading vector libraries, you need to make sure that the relevant properties (e.g.,`kb_name` `vector_name`, and `embed_model`) are set correctly in order to load the correct vector libraries. 
- This method is safe to use in a multi-threaded environment, but when saving a vector library, you should ensure that no other operations are modifying the vector library to avoid data inconsistencies.
- If you encounter a situation where the path does not exist and you cannot create a path while saving the vector library, the operation may fail. Therefore, when you call this method, you should ensure that your application has sufficient permissions to create a directory or write to a file.

### FunctionDef get_doc_by_ids(self, ids)
**get_doc_by_ids**: The function of this function is to get the corresponding list of document objects according to the list of IDs provided. 

**Parameters**:
- `ids`: A list of strings that indicates the IDs of the documents to be retrieved.

**Code Description**:
`get_doc_by_ids`The function first `load_vector_store`loads a thread-safe FAISS vector library instance by calling a method. The loaded vector library instance provides a context manager that ensures secure access and manipulation of the vector library in a multi-threaded environment. After successfully loading the vector library instance, the function uses Python list derivation to iterate through the provided list of IDs, and`docstore` uses methods to try to obtain the document object corresponding to each ID by accessing the properties of the vector library instance (a dictionary-type store).`get` If an ID does `docstore`not exist in , the return value is`None`. 

The relationship between this function and`load_vector_store` the method is that it relies on the `load_vector_store`thread-safe vector library instance provided by the method to get document objects safely and efficiently. `load_vector_store`The method ensures that the operation of the FAISS vector library is safe in a multi-threaded environment, which is`get_doc_by_ids` essential for functions when performing document retrieval. 

**Note**:
- Make sure that the vector library has been correctly loaded and contains the vector data of the target document before calling this function, otherwise the document object cannot be retrieved.
- The returned list of document objects may contain `None`values, which indicate that some of the provided IDs do not exist in the document store of the vector library. The caller needs to handle this appropriately. 

**Example output**:
Assuming that a list of IDs is provided`["doc1", "doc2", "doc3"]`, and that there are corresponding document objects in the document store of the vector library, this function might return a list of document objects as follows:
```
[<Document: id=doc1, content="文档1的内容">, <Document: id=doc2, content="文档2的内容">, <Document: id=doc3, content="文档3的内容">]
```
If an ID, such as "doc3", does not exist in the document store, the corresponding location will return`None`:
```
[<Document: id=doc1, content="文档1的内容">, <Document: id=doc2, content="文档2的内容">, None]
```
***
### FunctionDef del_doc_by_ids(self, ids)
**del_doc_by_ids**: The function of this function is to delete documents in the vector library based on the list of IDs provided. 

**Parameters**:
- `ids`: A list of strings containing the ID of the document to be removed from the vector library.

**Code Description**:
`del_doc_by_ids`The function first `load_vector_store`loads a thread-safe FAISS vector library instance by calling a method. This step ensures that operations on the vector library are safe in a multi-threaded environment. Once the vector library instance is loaded,`with` create a context manager with statements and `acquire`methods that are safe to get the vector library resources to work with. Inside this context manager, you can call the method of the vector library instance`delete` and pass in the parameters `ids`to delete the document with the specified ID. 

From a functional point of view, it`del_doc_by_ids` is closely related to the sum`load_vector_store` method it calls`acquire`. `load_vector_store`Responsible for loading and returning a thread-safe vector library instance, which is a prerequisite for any vector library operation. Methods, on the other hand`acquire`, provide a secure environment to ensure that data contention or inconsistencies are not caused by multi-threaded access when deleting operations. 

**Note**:
- Before calling `del_doc_by_ids`the function, make sure that each ID in the incoming ID list is the document ID that actually exists in the vector library. If you try to delete an ID that does not exist, depending on the implementation of the FAISS library, this may result in an error or simply ignore the operation. 
- Since `del_doc_by_ids`it involves modifying the vector library, it is recommended that you make a proper backup of the vector library before and after performing this operation to prevent accidental data loss. 
- This function is useful for scenarios where you need to delete documents in bulk from a vector library, such as during a document update or cleanup process.
***
### FunctionDef do_init(self)
**do_init**: The function of this function is to initialize the FaissKBService object. 

****Arguments: This function has no explicit arguments. 

**Code Description**: `do_init` Methods `FaissKBService` are a key method of the class that completes the initialization of an object. In this method, we first check `self.vector_name` if we have already been assigned a value, and if not, set it to `self.embed_model` a value of . This step ensures that the vector name is set correctly and is the basis for subsequent operations such as obtaining the vector storage path. 

Next, the`do_init` method calls `self.get_kb_path()` the method to get the path to the knowledge base and assigns this path to  the `self.kb_path` property. This step is to ensure that the knowledge base path is set correctly, so that subsequent operations on the knowledge base can be carried out based on the correct path. 

Next, the`do_init` method calls `self.get_vs_path()` the method to get the path of the vector store and assign that path to the `self.vs_path` property. The purpose of this step is to ensure that the vector storage path is set correctly, so that subsequent storage and access to the vector can be based on the correct path. 

Through these steps, the`do_init` method provides the `FaissKBService` necessary initialization settings for subsequent operations on the object, including the setting of the knowledge base path and the vector storage path, as well as the confirmation of the vector name. These settings are the basis for the correct subsequent operation. 

**Note**: Before using `do_init` the method, make sure that `self.embed_model` has been assigned correctly, as the  method will use `do_init` as the vector name if  the vector name is not explicitly set.`self.embed_model` In addition,`do_init` the correct execution of methods depends on `get_kb_path` `get_vs_path` the correct implementation of the sum method, so you `do_init` need to make sure that both methods return the knowledge base path and the vector storage path correctly before you call the method. 
***
### FunctionDef do_create_kb(self)
**do_create_kb**: The function of this function is to create a knowledge base. 

**Parameter**: This function has no explicit arguments, it accesses`self` the properties of the class instance. 

**Code Description**: `do_create_kb`The function first checks whether a `self.vs_path`path specified by the specified path exists, and if it does not, then creates the path. This step ensures that the directory where the vector data is stored is available. Next, the function calls the`load_vector_store` method. `load_vector_store`The purpose of the method is to load and return a thread-safe FAISS vector library instance, which is done by accessing`FaissKBService` the class instance's`kb_name` and`vector_name` `embed_model`properties that specify the knowledge base name, vector name, and embedding model to be loaded, respectively. The loaded vector library is thread-safe, allowing you to securely add, delete, and search documents in a multi-threaded environment. 

From a functional point of view, `do_create_kb`functions prepare the necessary environment for subsequent knowledge base operations such as adding documents, searching for documents, and so on by ensuring the existence of vector storage paths and loading vector libraries. This process is`FaissKBService` one of the basic steps for class management and manipulation of the FAISS vector library. 

**Note**:
- Before calling `do_create_kb`the function, make sure that the `vs_path`property is set correctly, as it determines where the vector data is stored. 
- This function relies on `load_vector_store`methods to load vector libraries, so you should make sure that`kb_name` the and`vector_name` `embed_model`properties are configured correctly to specify which vector library to load and which embedding model to use. 
***
### FunctionDef do_drop_kb(self)
**do_drop_kb**: The function of this function is to delete the knowledge base. 

**Parameters**: This function does not accept any external parameters. 

**Code Description**: `do_drop_kb` A method  is `FaissKBService` a member method of a class that is primarily responsible for deleting the entire knowledge base. The method first calls `clear_vs` the method to clear the vector data from the knowledge base. According to `clear_vs` the method's documentation, this step deletes all the content in the vector library and does so by deleting all file records in the database that are related to the knowledge base. This is an important pre-processing step to ensure that the relevant vector data has been cleared before the KB file is physically deleted. 

Next, the`do_drop_kb` method tries to `shutil.rmtree` use the function to delete the physical folder of the knowledge base. This step is done by passing `self.kb_path` as a parameter, where  represents `self.kb_path` the path to the knowledge base folder. If any exceptions are encountered during the deletion process, the method catches the exceptions and does not process them further, which means that the specific processing logic in the exception case may need to be added in the future according to actual needs. 

**Note**:
- Before you call `do_drop_kb` the method, make sure that you have backed up your important data. Once this method is performed, the knowledge base and all the data it contains will be permanently deleted, an irreversible operation. 
- Make sure that  is `self.kb_path` set correctly and points to the physical path of the knowledge base that needs to be deleted. 
- Considering that there is no detailed logic for exception handling, developers should pay attention to the monitoring and handling of exceptions when using this method to avoid potential problems.

The main use cases of this method in a project include resetting or deleting the knowledge base, especially when the knowledge base data needs to be completely purged to free up storage space or initialize a new knowledge base. By clearing the vector data and then deleting the physical folder, the`do_drop_kb` method ensures a complete purge of the knowledge base. 
***
### FunctionDef do_search(self, query, top_k, score_threshold)
**do_search**: The function of this function is to perform a similarity search and return the list of the most relevant documents and their corresponding scores, based on a given query string. 

**Parameters**:
- `query`: The query string that needs to be searched.
- `top_k`: The number of the most relevant documents returned.
- `score_threshold`: Score threshold, which will only be included in the results if the similarity score of the document is above this threshold. The default value is`SCORE_THRESHOLD`. 

**Code Description**:
`do_search`The function first vectorizes the query string through `EmbeddingsFunAdapter`the instantiation of the class and uses`self.embed_model` it as an embedding model `query`to obtain the embedding vector of the query. `EmbeddingsFunAdapter`A class is an adapter designed to convert text into embedding vectors, and it supports both synchronous and asynchronous embedding representation transformations of text. 

Subsequently, the function invocation `self.load_vector_store()`method obtains a thread-safe FAISS vector library instance. `load_vector_store`The method is responsible for loading and returning an `ThreadSafeFaiss`instance that encapsulates the operations of the FAISS vector library, ensuring thread safety in a multi-threaded environment. The loaded vector library contains pre-indexed document vectors that are used to perform similarity searches. 

After successfully fetching an instance of the vector library, the function uses`acquire` methods to access the vector library in a thread-safe manner and calls `similarity_search_with_score_by_vector`methods to perform a similarity search. The method accepts the embedding vector of the query,`top_k` the number of returned documents specified by the parameter, and `score_threshold`the score threshold as inputs, and returns the documents that are most relevant to the query`top_k` and their similarity scores. 

Finally, the function returns the search results, which are the list of the most relevant documents and their corresponding scores.

**Note**:
- Before using the `do_search`function, make sure it`self.embed_model`'s set up correctly, as it determines how the query string is vectorized. 
- `top_k`The parameter should be a positive integer representing the number of most relevant documents that need to be returned.
- The score threshold `score_threshold`is used to filter documents with similarity scores below this threshold, which can be adjusted according to actual needs. 

**Example output**:
For example, for the query string "Artificial Intelligence",`top_k` set to 3 and `score_threshold`set to 0.5, the function might return a result like this:
```
[
    (Document(id="doc1", title="人工智能基础", content="..."), 0.95),
    (Document(id="doc2", title="人工智能应用", content="..."), 0.85),
    (Document(id="doc3", title="人工智能未来", content="..."), 0.75)
]
```
This means that the three documents most relevant to the query "artificial intelligence" were found, with similarity scores of 0.95, 0.85, and 0.75, respectively.
***
### FunctionDef do_add_doc(self, docs)
**do_add_doc**: The function of this function is to add documents to the knowledge base and return the added document information. 

**Parameters**:
- `docs`: A list of document objects of type that need to be added to the knowledge base`List[Document]`. 
- `**kwargs`: Keyword parameters, which can include`ids` `not_refresh_vs_cache`options such as and . 

**Code Description**:
`do_add_doc`Methods first call `_docs_to_embeddings`private methods to convert the list of document objects into a vector and metadata format, which helps to reduce the lock time of the vector library and improve efficiency. Then, the`load_vector_store` thread-safe FAISS vector library instance is loaded through the method, and the `acquire`method is used to safely obtain the operation permission of the vector library. In this context manager, use `add_embeddings`methods to add the text, vectors, and metadata of a document to a vector library, and store them based on`kwargs` the IDs specified in the`ids` parameters. If `kwargs`it is not set`not_refresh_vs_cache` to ,`True` the method is called `save_local`to save the current state of the vector library to the local path`self.vs_path`. Finally, a list of information containing document IDs and metadata is constructed and returned. At the end of the method, the calling`torch_gc` function cleans up PyTorch's cache memory to avoid memory overflows or performance degradation. 

**Note**:
- Make sure that the parameters you pass in`docs` are a valid list of document objects. 
- You`kwargs` `ids`can specify the ID of the added document using the parameters in it, and if you don't specify it, the vector library will automatically generate the ID. 
- If you don't want to refresh the vector library cache every time you add a document, you can`kwargs` skip saving the vector library to your local location by using Yes in the`not_refresh_vs_cache``True` settings. 
- `torch_gc`The function is called to clean up the cache to manage memory usage, especially when processing large amounts of data. 

**Example output**:
The call `do_add_doc(docs=[Document1, Document2], ids=[1, 2])`might return a list like this:
```python
[
    {"id": 1, "metadata": {"title": "文档1标题"}},
    {"id": 2, "metadata": {"title": "文档2标题"}}
]
```
This list contains the ID and metadata information for each Chinese file added to the knowledge base.
***
### FunctionDef do_delete_doc(self, kb_file)
**do_delete_doc**: The function of this function is to delete the corresponding document vector based on the given knowledge base file. 

**Parameters**:
- `kb_file`: KnowledgeFile object, which represents the knowledge base file to be deleted.
- `**kwargs`: Keyword parameter to provide additional configuration options.

**Code Description**:
`do_delete_doc`The function first `load_vector_store`loads a thread-safe FAISS vector library instance by calling a method. Next, it traverses the document store () in the vector library`vs.docstore._dict` to find the document ID in its metadata`source` that `kb_file.filename`matches the field (case insensitive). Once found, store these IDs in a list`ids`. If the `ids`list is not empty, i.e., there are documents that need to be deleted, then the method is called`vs.delete(ids)` to delete them. 

In addition, the function checks the keyword arguments`not_refresh_vs_cache`. If the parameter does not exist or its value is`False`, the method is called `vs.save_local(self.vs_path)`to save the updated vector library to the local path. This step ensures that the state of the vector library is consistent with the actual documentation. 

Finally, the function returns a list of deleted document IDs`ids`. 

**Note**:
- Before calling this function, make sure that the incoming `kb_file`object correctly represents the knowledge base file you want to delete, and that the file already exists in the knowledge base. 
- Deleting the content of the vector library will directly affect the contents, so make sure that you have made the appropriate backup or confirmed the necessity of the operation before doing so.
- `not_refresh_vs_cache`Parameters allow the caller to control whether or not the local vector library cache is updated immediately, which can be useful when bulk delete operations to avoid frequent disk writes.

**Example output**:
```python
# 假设删除操作找到并删除了两个文档，其ID分别为'123'和'456'
deleted_ids = do_delete_doc(kb_file)
print(deleted_ids)  # 输出: ['123', '456']
```
In this example, the `do_delete_doc`function returns a list of deleted document IDs. This indicates that both documents have been successfully deleted from the vector library. 
***
### FunctionDef do_clear_vs(self)
**do_clear_vs**: The function of this function is to clear a specific vector store. 

**Parameters**: This function does not accept any external parameters. 

**Code Description**:  A `do_clear_vs` function is `FaissKBService` a method of the class that clears the vector store associated with a specific knowledge base name(`kb_name`s) and vector name(`vector_name`s). The function first `kb_faiss_pool.atomic` ensures that the operation on `kb_faiss_pool` is atomic through the context manager  , and then calls `pop` the  method to remove the `kb_faiss_pool` specified key-value pair from . The key here is a tuple consisting of the knowledge base name and the vector name`(self.kb_name, self.vector_name)`. `pop` The purpose of the method is to remove the object from the cache pool and return the specified key, and if the key does not exist, nothing is done. 

Next, the function attempts to delete the physical path of the vector store `self.vs_path`. This is achieved by calling `shutil.rmtree` the method, which recursively deletes the folder and all of its contents. If any exceptions are encountered during the deletion process (such as non-existent paths or permission issues), the exceptions are caught and ignored to ensure the stability of the program. 

Finally, the function uses `os.makedirs` a method to recreate the path of the vector store, with`exist_ok=True` parameters to ensure that an exception is not thrown if the path already exists. This step is to ensure that even if the vector store is cleared, the associated path structure is still preserved for subsequent vector storage operations. 

**Note**:
- Before calling `do_clear_vs` the function, you should make sure that the knowledge base name(`kb_name`s) and vector name(`vector_name`s) are set correctly, as this information will be used to locate the vector store that needs to be cleared. 
- Because `do_clear_vs` the function deletes all files and folders under the physical path, you should be cautious when calling this function to avoid accidentally deleting important data. 
- When using functions in a multi-threaded or multi-process environment `do_clear_vs` , care should be taken to synchronize and concurrency controls to prevent data contention or inconsistencies.

### FunctionDef exist_doc(self, file_name)
**exist_doc**: The function of this function is to determine whether the specified file name exists in the knowledge base. 

**Parameters**:
- `file_name`: The name of the file to be queried, of type as a string.

**Code Description**:
`exist_doc` The function first calls the method of its parent class `exist_doc` to check if the specified file name already exists in the database. If the parent class method returns `True`, indicating that the file already exists in the database, then this function returns `"in_db"` a  string, indicating that the file exists in the database. 

If the file is not in the database, the function then checks whether the file exists in the repository `content` folder. This is done by concatenating the knowledge base path (`self.kb_path`) and `"content"` subdirectories, and then checking if there is a file corresponding to under the concatenation path `file_name` . If the file does exist `content` in the folder, the function will return `"in_folder"` a string indicating that the file exists in the folder. 

If neither of the above is true, i.e., the file is neither in the database nor in the folder, the function will return `False`, indicating that the file does not exist in the knowledge base. 

**Note**:
- Make sure that this function`self.kb_path` is set up correctly to point to the root of the knowledge base before calling it. 
- There are three possible return values for this function: in_db, in_folder, and  , `False`which indicate that the file exists in the database, in a folder, and not in the knowledge base, respectively. 

**Example output**:
- If the file exists in the database: `"in_db"`
- If the file exists in a folder: `"in_folder"`
- If the file doesn't exist in the knowledge base: `False`

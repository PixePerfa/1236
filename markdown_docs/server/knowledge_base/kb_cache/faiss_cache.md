## FunctionDef _new_ds_search(self, search)
**_new_ds_search**: The function of this function is to find and return the corresponding document or unfound information based on the search string provided. 

**Parameters**:
- `search`: A string that needs to be searched to find the corresponding document in the internal dictionary.

**Code Description**:
This function receives a parameter called`search` a string that looks up the corresponding entry in an internally maintained dictionary`_dict`. The function first checks for`search` the presence in `_dict`the in. If it doesn't exist, the function will return a formatted string stating that the given ID was not found. If a corresponding entry is found, the function will further check whether the entry is an`Document` instance of a type. If so, the function will add a field to the document's metadata with the`id` value `search`of the parameter. Finally, the function `Document`will return the entry regardless of whether it is an instance or not. 

**Note**:
- The type of value returned by the function depends on the finding. If no corresponding entry is found, a string will be returned; If an entry is found, the return value will be the entry itself, possibly of type`Document` or something else. 
- When using this function, you need to make sure that it `_dict`has been properly initialized and populated with the appropriate data. 
- When an `Document`instance of the type is returned, it`metadata` will contain an additional `id`field with a value corresponding to the search string. 

**Example output**:
- If the searched ID is not `_dict`found, the possible return value is: "ID 12345 not found."
- If the search ID `_dict`is found and the corresponding entry is an `Document`instance, the updated instance will be returned`metadata``Document`. 
## ClassDef ThreadSafeFaiss
**ThreadSafeFaiss**: The function of the ThreadSafeFaiss class is to provide a thread-safe encapsulation for manipulating and managing the FAISS vector library. 

**Properties**:
- `key`: The key of an object that identifies a specific vector library.
- `_obj`: The object that stores the actual FAISS vector library.
- `docs_count`: Indicates the number of Chinese files in the vector library.

**Code Description**:
The ThreadSafeFaiss class inherits from ThreadSafeObject, adding specific functionality related to the FAISS vector library. This class is primarily used to safely manipulate FAISS vector libraries in a multi-threaded environment, including operations such as document counting, saving to disk, and emptying vector libraries. 

- `__repr__` Methods provide a string representation of the class, including the class name, key, object, and number of documents.
- `docs_count` The method returns the number of Chinese files in the vector library, which is achieved by `_obj.docstore._dict` the length of the query. 
- `save` The method is used to save the vector library to a specified disk path. If the path does not exist and `create_path` the parameter  is true, the path is created. After the save operation is completed, a log message is recorded. 
- `clear` method is used to empty all documents in the vector library. After the emptying operation is complete, a log message is recorded.

**Note**:
- When using `save` the and `clear` methods, locks are acquired through  the `acquire` methods to ensure thread safety. This means that the vector library object will not be accessible to other threads during the execution of these operations. 
- When modifying `_obj` a property, you should go through `obj` the property's setter method to ensure thread-safety. 
- When working with vector libraries in a multi-threaded environment, using ThreadSafeFaiss can effectively avoid data races and other concurrency issues.

**Example output**:
Suppose you have an instance of ThreadSafeFaiss `key` that  is a "example_key",`_obj` which is a FAISS vector library object, and there are 100 documents in the vector library. Calling `__repr__` the method might return a string like this:
`"<ThreadSafeFaiss: key: example_key, obj: <FAISS向量库对象的表示>, docs_count: 100>"`

With this class, developers can safely and efficiently manage and manipulate FAISS vector libraries in a multi-threaded environment without worrying about thread safety.
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of this function is to generate and return a string representation of the object. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code Description**: `__repr__` A method `ThreadSafeFaiss` is a special method of the class that provides an official string representation of an object. This representation is often used for debugging and logging, making it easier for developers to understand the state of an object. In this method, `type(self).__name__` a formatted string is constructed by  first getting the class name of the object, then by accessing the object's `key` properties and `_obj` properties, and by calling  the method `docs_count` to get the number of documents. This string contains the object's class name, key value, corresponding object number, and number of documents, which is useful for understanding and debugging `ThreadSafeFaiss` the state of the object. 

`key` Attributes provide a unique identifier for an object in a cache or other data structure and are obtained by accessing the object's `_key` properties. `docs_count` The method returns the number of Chinese files stored in the document, which is achieved by calculating `_obj.docstore._dict` the length. The property here `_obj` points to a document storage object, which`_dict` is the dictionary in that storage object that is used to save documents. 

In this way,`__repr__` the method `ThreadSafeFaiss` provides a detailed and easy-to-understand representation of the string for the object, including key state information such as the object's key value and the number of documents in storage. 

**Note**: When using `__repr__` methods, you need to make sure that `_obj` the  Properties and `_key` Properties have been initialized correctly, and  that `_obj.docstore._dict` you have the documentation that needs to be counted. If these properties or dictionaries are not initialized correctly, they can affect the accuracy of the string representation. 

**Output example**: Suppose an `ThreadSafeFaiss` object has a class name `ThreadSafeFaiss`with a key value of  , `"example_key"`and the corresponding `_obj` property points to a document storage object containing 3 documents, then calling `__repr__` the method  might return a string like this:
```
"<ThreadSafeFaiss: key: example_key, obj: <文档存储对象>, docs_count: 3>"
```
***
### FunctionDef docs_count(self)
**docs_count**: The function of this function is to return the number of Chinese files stored in the document. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code Description**: `docs_count` A function is `ThreadSafeFaiss` a method of the class that gets  the length of the current object stored in Chinese, `_dict` that is, the number of documents. Here,`self._obj.docstore` refers to a document storage object, but  rather `_dict` to the dictionary in that storage object that is used to hold the document. By calling `len` the length of  Function Compute, `_dict` you can get the total number of stored Chinese files. This method `ThreadSafeFaiss` is called in the instantiated object of the class, specifically in its `__repr__` method, and is used to generate a string representation of the object, which includes information about the number of documents. In this way, when you need to show or document `ThreadSafeFaiss` the state of an object, you can get key information, including the number of documents, directly through its string representation. 

**Note**: When using this function, you need to make sure that  it `self._obj.docstore._dict` has been initialized correctly and contains the documents that need to be counted. If `_dict` is  empty or not initialized correctly, this function will return `0` . 

**Example output**: Assuming `_dict` 3 documents are stored in , the `docs_count()` return value of will be `3` . 
***
### FunctionDef save(self, path, create_path)
**save**: The function of this function is to save the vector library to the specified path. 

**Parameters**:
- `path`: String type, which represents the target path saved by the vector library.
- `create_path`: Boolean type, which defaults to True, indicates whether to create a destination path if it does not exist.

**Code Description**:
`save` Functions first `acquire` securely fetch resources by calling methods, ensuring that operations in a multithreaded environment do not cause data contention or inconsistencies. After successfully obtaining the resource, the function checks whether the`path` path specified by the parameter exists, and if it does not exist and `create_path`the parameter is True, the path is created. Subsequently, the function calls `_obj.save_local` the method to save the vector library to the specified path. During the save process, information about the save operation is output through the logging function, including the key value of the vector library (obtained by calling `key` the method  ) and the target path of the save. When the save operation is complete, the previously acquired resources are released and the `_obj.save_local` return value of the method is returned. 

**Note**:
- When using this function, you need to ensure that the `path`provided parameters are valid file system paths, and that the current running environment has sufficient permissions to create folders or write files to this path. 
- If the `create_path`parameter is set to False and the specified path does not exist, no new path will be created and the save operation may fail. 
- This function is safe to use in a multi-threaded environment, but callers should ensure that any possible exceptions are handled correctly to avoid resource leaks or other surprises.

**Output example**: Since the main purpose of this function is to save a file to disk, its return value depends on `_obj.save_local` the implementation of the method, and usually does not output information directly. But in the logs, you can see something like this:
```
已将向量库 example_key 保存到磁盘
```
This indicates that the vector library with a key value`example_key` has been successfully saved to disk. 
***
### FunctionDef clear(self)
**clear**: The function of this function is to empty the vector library. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code Description**: The `clear` function is responsible for emptying the vector library represented by the current object. It first creates an empty list `ret`that stores the returned results of the delete operation. By using `with self.acquire()` the Context Manager, functions ensure secure access to and manipulation of vector libraries in a multi-threaded environment. Inside this context manager, first get a list of IDs for all documents in the vector library, and then check if the list is not empty. If it's not empty, call `_obj.delete(ids)` the method  to delete the documents and store the returned results in `ret` . In addition, the function `assert len(self._obj.docstore._dict) == 0` ensures that all documents have been deleted and the vector library has been successfully emptied by asserting it. Finally, a log message is logged indicating that a particular vector library has been emptied, which `self.key` is used to obtain a unique identifier for the vector library. 

From a functional point of view,`clear` a function is closely related to the  objects and s it calls `acquire` `key` . `acquire` Functions provide a thread-safe environment to ensure that data contention does not occur when a delete operation is performed. `key` Functions are used to obtain the unique identifier of the vector library, which is useful for logging and helping developers and maintainers keep track of which vector library was emptied. 

**Note**: When using `clear` functions, you need to make sure that the properties of the vector library `_obj` have been initialized correctly and `_obj.docstore._dict` correctly reflect the storage state of the vector library's Chinese files. Also, considering that assertions are used in functions to verify that the vector library was successfully emptied, this should be ensured when used in a production environment to avoid exceptions caused by failed assertions. 

**Example of output**: Suppose there are several documents stored in the vector library, and `clear` if the deletion is successful, the function will return a list of the results of the deletion operation if the deletion is successful. For example, if the deletion is successful, the following list may be returned:
```
[True, True, ...]
```
If the vector library was originally empty, or if no documents were actually deleted during the deletion process, an empty list is returned:
```
[]
```
***
## ClassDef _FaissPool
**_FaissPool**: The function of the _FaissPool class is to manage and operate vector stores based on the FAISS library. 

**Properties**:
- The class inherits from `CachePool`, and therefore has `CachePool` all the properties and methods of . 

**Code Description**:
The _FaissPool class provides three main ways to manage vector stores:`new_vector_store` ,`save_vector_store` , and `unload_vector_store`. 

1. `new_vector_store` method is used to create a new vector store. It accepts the embedding model name and embedding device as parameters, which it uses `EmbeddingsFunAdapter` to adapt to different embedding models and creates a document object `doc` as initialization data. It then uses `FAISS.from_documents` methods to create a new FAISS vector store based on this document object and embedding model, while setting up L2 normalization and distance strategies. Once created, it deletes this initialized document object in order to return an empty vector store. 

2. `save_vector_store` The method is used to save the vector with a specified name and store it to disk. If a vector store with the corresponding name is found in the cache, it calls the vector store `save` method to save it to the specified path. 

3. `unload_vector_store` The method is used to unload and free the vector store with the specified name from the cache. If a vector store with the corresponding name is found in the cache, it removes the vector store from the cache and then records a log message indicating that the vector library has been successfully released.

**Note**:
- When `new_vector_store` you use methods to create a vector store, you need to ensure that the embedding model name and embedding device you pass in are valid, as this will affect the creation of the vector store and the subsequent vector retrieval performance. 
-  `save_vector_store` If you do not provide a save path when using the method to save a vector store, you need to make sure that the default save path has been configured for the vector store object. 
- Before you call  the method to `unload_vector_store` unmount a vector store, you should ensure that no other operations are using the vector store to avoid data loss or access conflicts. 

**Example output**:
Since these methods are mainly used for the management of vector stores, their output usually does not return data directly to the user. For example, the`new_vector_store` method returns an empty initialized FAISS vector storage object, while `save_vector_store` the  sum `unload_vector_store` method does not return a value, and their execution results are mainly reflected by the log information and the state change of the vector storage. 
### FunctionDef new_vector_store(self, embed_model, embed_device)
**new_vector_store**: The function of this function is to create a new vector storage space. 

**Parameters**:
- `embed_model`: String type, default is  .`EMBEDDING_MODEL` Lets you specify the name of the embedded model. 
- `embed_device`: String type, default is `embedding_device()` the return value of the function. Lets you specify the type of device in which the compute is embedded. 

**Code Description**:
`new_vector_store` The function first `EmbeddingsFunAdapter` instantiates an embedding model adapter  via the class, which `embed_model` handles the text embedding transformation based on the parameters passed in. Next, the function creates an object that contains the initialization content and metadata `Document` . After that `FAISS.from_documents` , a new FAISS vector storage instance is created using the document object, embedding model adapter, L2 normalization, and inner product distance strategy as parameters. During the creation process, a document is added to the vector store and then deleted immediately to initialize an empty vector storage space. Finally, the function returns this initialized vector store instance. 

**Note**:
- Before you use this function, you need to make sure that  the `embed_model` embedding model you specify already exists and is available. 
- `embed_device` Parameters should be set based on the hardware configuration of the actual operating environment to ensure that embedded computation can be performed on the most appropriate device (e.g., GPU, MPS, or CPU).
- The vector store instance created by this function is empty, that is, there is no vector data that contains any documents. It is usually used to initialize the vector storage space, and then you need to add specific document vectors to it by other methods.

**Example output**:
Since this function returns a FAISS vector storage instance, and the specific instance content depends on the runtime environment and parameters, it is not easy to provide a concrete output example. However, it can be expected that the returned vector store instance is an initialized FAISS object, ready to receive and manage document vector data. 
***
### FunctionDef save_vector_store(self, kb_name, path)
**save_vector_store**: The function of this function is to save the vector store. 

**Parameters**:
- `kb_name`: String type, specifying the name of the knowledge base to be saved.
- `path`: String type, optional, specifies the path where the vector is stored. If not provided, the default path is used.

**Code Description**:
`save_vector_store` The function first attempts to  get the thread-safe object associated `get` with the given knowledge base name(s) from the cache pool by calling the function`kb_name`. If the object is successfully obtained, the function will call the object's `save` method and pass it an  optional path parameter `path` . This process implements the saving operation of the vector store. 

Functionally, a`get` function is a critical step in retrieving a thread-safe object associated with a given key from the cache pool. It ensures that the required object has been successfully loaded and is available before the save operation can be made. This is essential to ensure data consistency and prevent errors during the preservation process. 

**Note**:
- When using `save_vector_store` functions, you should ensure that the knowledge base name(s) provided `kb_name`exists in the cache. If it doesn't exist, the function will do nothing and return `None` . 
- The saved path(s) provided `path`should ensure that it is valid, as invalid or unprovided paths may result in the save operation failing or the default path being used. 

**Example output**:
Suppose there is a `"example_kb"` knowledge base object called , and that object is already loaded into the cache. Calling `save_vector_store("example_kb", "/path/to/store")` will  save the vector store of that knowledge base object to the specified path. If `"example_kb"` is  not present in the cache, the function will do nothing and return `None` . 
***
### FunctionDef unload_vector_store(self, kb_name)
**unload_vector_store**: The function of this function is to unload and release the specified vector library from the cache pool. 

**Parameters**:
- `kb_name`: String type, specifying the name of the vector library to be unloaded and released.

**Code Description**:
`unload_vector_store` A function is `_FaissPool` a method of the class that is used to unload and release a vector library with a specified name. The function first calls `get` the method to try to get the vector library object associated  with the given name from the cache pool `kb_name` . If an object is successfully retrieved, the`get` method ensures that the loading state of the object is complete, which is achieved through the object's `wait_for_loading` method, which ensures that the object is already available before proceeding with subsequent operations. 

Once the object is obtained, the function then calls `pop` the Method to remove the object from the cache pool  based on the name of the vector library provided `kb_name` . After the removal operation is successful, a message is logged indicating that the specified vector library has been successfully released. 

Throughout the process, the`get` method ensures that the unloading operation will only occur if the vector library object actually exists and is loaded. `pop` The method, on the other hand, takes care of the actual removal operation and handles the removal logic of the objects in the cache pool. 

**Note**:
- When using this function, you should ensure that the vector library name provided `kb_name` actually exists in the cache pool. If it doesn't exist, the function will do nothing. 
- This function helps to monitor and debug the unloading process of the vector library by logging the results of the operation.
- In a multi-threaded environment, the`get` thread-safe mechanism of the method ensures that the loading state of the object is completed before the unloading operation is carried out, avoiding potential race conditions. 
***
## ClassDef KBFaissPool
**KBFaissPool**: The function of the KBFaissPool class is to manage and load vector storage pools based on the FAISS library. 

**Properties**:
- inherits from  the `_FaissPool` class, and therefore owns `_FaissPool` all the properties and methods of . 

**Code Description**:
The KBFaissPool class primarily provides `load_vector_store` methods for loading or creating vector stores. The method accepts the knowledge base name (`kb_name`), vector name (`vector_name`), whether to create a new vector store (`create`), embedding model name (`embed_model`), and embedding device (`embed_device`) as parameters. 

1. The method first attempts to get the specified vector store from the internal cache. If it is not found, it initializes a new `ThreadSafeFaiss` object and attempts to load the vector store from disk or create a new vector store based on the parameters. 
   
2. If a file exists under the specified path `index.faiss` , the vector store is loaded from disk and the knowledge base embedding is loaded using the specified embedding model and device. During the loading process, the vector is L2 normalized and the distance strategy is set to the inner product. 
   
3. If no file exists in the specified path `index.faiss` and  the parameter `create` is true, a new empty vector store is created and saved to disk. 
   
4. If neither the file exists `index.faiss` , but`create` the arguments are also false, an exception is thrown, indicating that the specified knowledge base does not exist. 

After the vector store is loaded or created, the method stores the `ThreadSafeFaiss` object in the internal cache and returns the object. 

**Note**:
- When you call `load_vector_store` the method, you need to make sure that the knowledge base name and vector name passed in are valid so that the vector store is loaded or created correctly. 
- If the specified vector store already exists in the internal cache, the method returns the cache object directly without repeated loading or creation.
- When creating a new vector store, you need to ensure that the embedding model and device parameters are correctly configured to ensure the performance and compatibility of the vector store.

**Example output**:
 The `load_vector_store` sample output that may be returned by  the invoking method is an `ThreadSafeFaiss` object that encapsulates the operation and management of the FAISS vector store, allowing threads to safely access and modify the vector store. 
### FunctionDef load_vector_store(self, kb_name, vector_name, create, embed_model, embed_device)
**load_vector_store**: This function is used to load or create a vector store for a specified knowledge base. 

**Parameters**:
- `kb_name`: String type, specifying the name of the knowledge base where you want to load or create a vector store.
- `vector_name`: String type, optional, default is None. Specifies the name of the vector store. If not provided, the embedding model name is used as the vector name.
- `create`: Boolean type, optional, default is True. Indicates whether to create a new vector store if the specified vector store does not exist.
- `embed_model`: String type, optional, default`EMBEDDING_MODEL`. Lets you specify the name of the embedded model. 
- `embed_device`: String type, optional parameter, determined by function by default`embedding_device()`. Lets you specify the type of device in which the compute is embedded. 

**Code Description**:
This function first attempts to acquire a mutex to ensure thread safety. Then, try to get the corresponding vector store from the cache based on the knowledge base name and vector name (or embedding model name if no vector name is provided). If the vector store does not exist in the cache, the`create` value of the parameter decides whether to create a new vector store or throw an exception. The process of creating a vector store involves initializing an `ThreadSafeFaiss`instance and adding it to the cache. Then, depending on whether the vector store already exists on disk, choose whether to load the vector store from disk or create a new empty vector store. After the load or creation is complete, the vector storage instance is assigned to`ThreadSafeFaiss` the properties of the instance `obj`and the load is marked as complete. If the vector store already exists in the cache, the mutex is directly released. Finally, the function returns the vector store instance in the cache. 

**Note**:
- When using this function in a multi-threaded environment, the internal mutex ensures thread safety.
- If the `create`parameter is False and the specified vector store does not exist, a runtime error is thrown. 
- Before calling this function, you should make sure that`kb_name` and`vector_name`, if provided, are correct, as they directly affect the loading and creation of vector stores. 
- This function relies on `embedding_device()`a function to determine the type of device embedded in the computation, so you need to ensure that the relevant hardware and software are configured correctly. 

**Example output**:
Since this function returns an `ThreadSafeFaiss`instance, and the specific instance content depends on the runtime environment and parameters, it is not easy to provide a concrete example of the output. However, it can be expected that the returned vector store instance is an initialized state object`ThreadSafeFaiss`, ready to receive and manage document vector data. 
***
## ClassDef MemoFaissPool
**MemoFaissPool**: The function of the MemoFaissPool class is to load and manage vector storage pools based on the FAISS library in memory. 

**Properties**:
- inherits from  the `_FaissPool` class, and therefore owns `_FaissPool` all the properties and methods of . 

**Code Description**:
`MemoFaissPool` Classes `_FaissPool` provide an efficient way to manage FAISS vector storage by inheriting classes. It mainly uses `load_vector_store` methods to load or initialize vector stores. 

1. `load_vector_store` The method accepts three parameters:`kb_name` (knowledge base name), `embed_model`(embedding model, defaults to ), `EMBEDDING_MODEL`and `embed_device`(embedding device, which defaults to the `embedding_device()` function). The method first tries to get a vector store with the specified name from the cache. If it is not found, it will create a new `ThreadSafeFaiss` object and add it to the cache. In this process, it uses a thread-safe locking mechanism to ensure the atomicity of the operation. 

2. When an object is initialized `ThreadSafeFaiss` , the `_FaissPool` Class `new_vector_store` method is called to create an empty vector store. This process involves creating a vector store using a specified embedding model and device, ensuring flexibility and customizability in the creation and configuration of the vector store. 

3. When the vector store is loaded, the`load_vector_store` method `finish_loading` marks the loading state of the vector store by calling the method, ensuring that the vector store is ready to be used. 

**Note**:
- When using `load_vector_store` methods, you need to ensure that the incoming knowledge base name, embedding model, and embedding device parameters are correct, as these parameters directly affect the creation and performance of the vector store. 
- This class uses a thread-safe locking mechanism to protect the loading process of vector storage, avoiding data inconsistencies that may occur during concurrent access and modification.
- Since `MemoFaissPool` a class inherits from `_FaissPool` , you need to have some understanding of the class and its methods before you can use it `_FaissPool` . 

**Example output**:
Since  the `load_vector_store` primary purpose of the method is to load or initialize a vector store, its immediate return value is an `ThreadSafeFaiss` object. This object represents a loaded or newly created vector store that can be further used for vector retrieval or management operations. For example, if a vector store named "knowledge_base" is successfully loaded, the returned `ThreadSafeFaiss` object will contain all the relevant information and operational interfaces for that vector store. 
### FunctionDef load_vector_store(self, kb_name, embed_model, embed_device)
**load_vector_store**: The function of this function is to load or initialize a vector repository and make it thread-safe. 

**Parameters**:
- `kb_name`: String type, which specifies the name of the knowledge base.
- `embed_model`: String type, default is  .`EMBEDDING_MODEL` Lets you specify the name of the embedded model. 
- `embed_device`: String type, default is `embedding_device()` the return value of the function. Lets you specify the type of device in which the compute is embedded. 

**Code Description**:
This function first attempts to acquire an atomic lock to ensure thread safety. Next, try to get the`kb_name` corresponding vector storage object from the cache. If it is not found,`cache` a`None` new instance is created `ThreadSafeFaiss`and associated with it and `kb_name`set in the cache. In this process, a new vector storage space is initialized, which is achieved by calling `new_vector_store`a function that creates a vector storage based on the specified embedding model and computing device. When the initialization of the vector store is complete, a method is called `finish_loading`to mark the completion of the loading process. If the corresponding vector storage object is found in the cache, the atomic lock is released. Finally, the function returns the vector storage object fetched from the cache. 

**Note**:
- When this function is used in a multi-threaded environment, atom locks ensure that the operation is atomistic and thread-safe.
- When initializing the vector store, you need to ensure that the specified embedding model and compute devices are ready to avoid errors in subsequent operations.
- This function is created and loaded when the vector store object does not exist, which can be a time-consuming operation, so you should take this into account when designing your application logic.

**Example output**:
Since this function returns an `ThreadSafeFaiss`instance, the specific instance content depends on the runtime environment and parameters, so it is not easy to provide a concrete output example. However, it is to be expected that the returned vector store instance is an object that is initialized and ready to receive and manage document vector data`ThreadSafeFaiss`. 

In a project, `load_vector_store`functions are `upload_temp_docs`called by functions to load or initialize a temporary vector library when a file is uploaded and vectorized. This ensures that uploaded documents can be correctly added to the vector library to support subsequent search and retrieval operations. 
***
## FunctionDef worker(vs_name, name)
**worker**: This function is used to handle adding, searching, and deleting vector storage Chinese files. 

**Parameters**:
- `vs_name`: String type, specifying the name of the vector store.
- `name`: A string type that represents the name of the worker or user performing the current operation.

**Code Description**:
`worker`The function first sets the `vs_name`value of the parameter to "samples", which means that all operations will be done in a vector store named "samples". Next, the function `load_local_embeddings`loads the local embedding vector by calling the function. This step is necessary because embedding vectors are required to be used for both adding documents and searching for documents. 

The function randomly selects an integer`r` and `r`decides to add, search, or delete a document based on the value of the . Specifically, if it`r` is equal to 1, the document is added; If it `r`is equal to 2, the search document operation is executed; If it`r` is equal to 3, the document is deleted. 

When performing an add or search operation, the function works by `kb_faiss_pool.load_vector_store(vs_name).acquire(name)`getting the context manager of the vector store and ensures that the operation is thread-safe. Within this context manager,`r` the appropriate action is performed based on the value. When adding a document, use the `add_texts`method to add the text and the corresponding embedding vector to the vector store, and print the added document ID. When searching for documents, use`similarity_search_with_score` the method to search for the most similar documents based on the text and embedding vectors provided, and print the search results. 

If it `r`is equal to 3, that is, the document deletion operation is performed, the method is called outside the context manager `kb_faiss_pool.get(vs_name).clear()`to clear all documents in the specified vector store. This operation logs the information that performed the deletion operation. 

**Note**:
- When using `worker`functions, you need to make sure that`vs_name` the sum `name`parameters are correct, as they directly affect the operation of the vector store. 
- `load_local_embeddings`Function invocation relies on the correct embedding model configuration and compute device settings, so you`worker` should make sure that the relevant configuration is correct before executing the function. 
- `worker`The function simulates a simple vector storage operation scenario by randomly selecting the type of action (adding, searching, or deleting documents). In practice, the operating logic can be adapted to specific requirements.
- When using functions in a multithreaded environment`worker`, the context manager obtained through`acquire` methods ensures that the operation is thread-safe.

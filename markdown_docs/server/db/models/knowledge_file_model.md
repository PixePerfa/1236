## ClassDef KnowledgeFileModel
**KnowledgeFileModel**: The KnowledgeFileModel class is used to represent file information in the knowledge base. 

**Properties**:
- `id`: The unique identifier ID of the knowledge file.
- `file_name`:Filename.
- `file_ext`:Filename extension.
- `kb_name`: The name of the knowledge base to which it belongs.
- `document_loader_name`: The name of the document loader.
- `text_splitter_name`: The name of the text splitter.
- `file_version`: File version.
- `file_mtime`: The time when the file was last modified.
- `file_size`: File size.
- `custom_docs`: Identifies whether it is a custom document.
- `docs_count`: The number of documents to be sliced.
- `create_time`: The time when the file was created.

**Code Description**:
The KnowledgeFileModel class, which inherits from the Base class, is an ORM model that maps tables in a database`knowledge_file`. The model defines various attributes related to knowledge files, including file name, file extension, knowledge base name, document loader name, text splitter name, and so on. In addition, it includes information such as the version of the file, the time it was modified, the size, whether the document was customized, the number of documents to be sliced, and the time when it was created. 

In the project, the KnowledgeFileModel class is called by multiple functions, which mainly involves the addition, deletion, and modification of knowledge files. For example,`count_files_from_db` a function is used to count the number of files in a knowledge base,`list_files_from_db` a function is used to list all file names in a knowledge base, a `add_file_to_db`function is used to add new knowledge files to the database or update the information of existing files,`delete_file_from_db` and a `delete_files_from_db`function is used to delete a specified file or all files in a knowledge base from the database`file_exists_in_db`Functions are used to check whether a file already exists in the database, and functions`get_file_detail` are used to get the details of a file. 

**Note**:
- When you use the KnowledgeFileModel for database operations, you need to ensure that the parameters passed in comply with the types and constraints defined by the fields.
- For information such as file version, modification time, and size, you should pay attention to maintaining the values of these fields correctly when updating the file information to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data.

**Example output**:
Since the KnowledgeFileModel is an ORM model, manipulating an instance of the class directly will not produce a simple output. However, when `__repr__`you use the method to print an instance of the KnowledgeFileModel, you may get a string representation in the following format:
```
<KnowledgeFile(id='1', file_name='example.pdf', file_ext='.pdf', kb_name='DefaultKB', document_loader_name='PDFLoader', text_splitter_name='SpacyTextSplitter', file_version='1', create_time='2023-04-01 12:00:00')>
```
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of this function is to generate an official string representation of the KnowledgeFileModel object. 

**Arguments**: This function does not accept any arguments other than self. 

**Code Description**: `__repr__`Method is a special method in Python that defines the "official" string representation of an object. In this context, `__repr__`the method is used for the KnowledgeFileModel class, which is a database model class that represents the knowledge file. When this method is called, it returns a formatted string containing key information about the KnowledgeFileModel object, including: id, file_name (file name), file_ext (file extension), kb_name (knowledge base name), document_loader_name (document loader name), text_splitter_name (text splitter name), file_version (file version) and create_time (creation time). This string representation is very useful, especially in debugging and logging, as it provides a quick overview of the object. 

**Note**: `__repr__`The string returned by the method should reflect the state of the object as closely as possible, while keeping it concise and clear. In practice, developers may adjust the`__repr__` properties included in the return value as needed. In addition, while `__repr__`the main purpose is for debugging and development, it can also be used for user interface display, especially in scenarios where object information needs to be quickly displayed. 

**Example output**: Suppose you have a KnowledgeFileModel object with the following property values:
- id: 1
- file_name: "example.pdf"
- file_ext: ".pdf"
- kb_name: "General Knowledge"
- document_loader_name: "DefaultLoader"
- text_splitter_name: "SimpleSplitter"
- file_version: "v1.0"
- create_time: "2023-04-01 12:00:00"

Calling a method on this object`__repr__` will return the following string:
`"<KnowledgeFile(id='1', file_name='example.pdf', file_ext='.pdf', kb_name='General Knowledge', document_loader_name='DefaultLoader', text_splitter_name='SimpleSplitter', file_version='v1.0', create_time='2023-04-01 12:00:00')>"`

## ClassDef FileDocModel
**FileDocModel**: The FileDocModel class is used to represent a model of the relationship between a file and a vector library document. 

**Properties**:
- `id`: A unique identifier, a self-growing integer that uniquely identifies each document.
- `kb_name`: The name of the knowledge base, the string type, indicates the knowledge base to which the document belongs.
- `file_name`: The name of the file, the type of string, which indicates the original file name of the document.
- `doc_id`: Vector library document ID, string type, used to identify documents in the vector library.
- `meta_data`: Metadata, JSON type, defaults to an empty dictionary, used to store extra information about the document.

**Code Description**:
The FileDocModel class inherits from the Base class and is an ORM model that maps tables in a database`file_doc`. The model defines basic information fields related to file and vector library documents, including knowledge base name, file name, document ID, and metadata. In addition, by defining`__repr__` methods, you can provide a friendly string representation of the model instance for easy debugging and logging. 

In the project, the FileDocModel class is called by multiple functions, mainly used to handle operations related to database Chinese files, such as adding, querying, and deleting document information. For example, in a`add_docs_to_db` function, the ability to add document information to a database is implemented by creating an instance of a FileDocModel and adding it to a database session. In the`list_file_num_docs_id_by_kb_name_and_file_name` function, you can query the FileDocModel instance to list all the corresponding document IDs based on the knowledge base name and file name. In addition,`delete_docs_from_db` the sum `list_docs_from_db`function also shows how to use the FileDocModel to query and delete documents. 

**Note**:
- When using FileDocModel for database operations, you need to ensure that the incoming parameter types and field constraints meet the definitions to avoid data type errors or constraint violations.
- When processing metadata (meta_data) fields, considering that they are JSON types, attention should be paid to the correct data format and parsing methods to ensure the effective storage and query of metadata.

**Example output**:
Suppose there is a record in the database with the following field values:
- id: 1
- kb_name: "Knowledge Base 1"
- file_name: "File 1.pdf"
- doc_id: "doc123"
- meta_data: {"author": "Zhang San", "year": "2021"}

The method output of the record`__repr__` might be:
`<FileDoc(id='1', kb_name='知识库1', file_name='文件1.pdf', doc_id='doc123', metadata='{'author': '张三', 'year': '2021'}')>`
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of this function is to generate an official string representation of the object. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code Description**: `__repr__` A method is a special method in Python that defines the "official" string representation of an object. In this particular implementation,`__repr__` methods are used for  a `FileDocModel` class, which may represent a model related to a knowledge base file. This method returns a formatted string that contains several key properties of the object:`id` , `kb_name`(knowledge base name),`file_name` (file name), `doc_id`(document ID), and `metadata`(metadata). This formatted string representation allows developers to quickly identify the main properties of an object, which is especially useful during debugging or when outputting an object to the console. 

**Note**: `__repr__` When using methods, you should ensure that the returned string accurately reflects the key information of the object. Also, while this approach is primarily used for debugging and development, care should also be taken to keep the returned string readable. 

**Example output**: Suppose you have an `FileDocModel` object with the following properties:`id=1` ,,`kb_name='KnowledgeBase1'`,`file_name='document1.pdf'`,`doc_id='12345'`.`metadata='{"author": "John Doe", "date": "2023-04-01"}'` Calling a method on this object `__repr__` will return the following string:

```
<FileDoc(id='1', kb_name='KnowledgeBase1', file_name='document1.pdf', doc_id='12345', metadata='{"author": "John Doe", "date": "2023-04-01"}')>
```

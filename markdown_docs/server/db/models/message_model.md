## ClassDef MessageModel
**MessageModel**: The function of the MessageModel class is to define the data model of the chat history. 

**Properties**:
- `id`: The unique identifier ID of the chat log.
- `conversation_id`: Dialog ID, which identifies a session.
- `chat_type`: The type of chat, such as normal chat, customer service chat, etc.
- `query`: A question or input from a user.
- `response`: The answer of the system or model.
- `meta_data`: A JSON field that stores additional information, such as the knowledge base ID, for subsequent expansion.
- `feedback_score`: The user's rating of the chat answer out of 100.
- `feedback_reason`: Reason for user rating.
- `create_time`: The time when the record was created.

**Code Description**:
The MessageModel class inherits from Base and is used to define the data structure of the chat log. It contains the basic information of the chat history, such as chat ID, session ID, chat type, user question, model answer, metadata, user feedback, etc. This class maps the table structure in the database by defining the Column field of SQLAlchemy`message`. The `__tablename__`attribute specifies the corresponding table name in the database`message`. Each property is defined by a column instance, which includes information such as the data type, whether it is the primary key, the default value, index creation, comments, and so on. 

In the project, the MessageModel class is used for several function calls in the server/db/repository/message_repository.py file, mainly related to the addition of chat history, queries and feedback. For example, a`add_message_to_db` function to add a new chat history creates a MessageModel instance and adds it to the database. `get_message_by_id`The function uses the ID of the chat history to query the chat history. `feedback_message_to_db`The function is used to update the user feedback information for the chat history. `filter_message`The function filters the chat history based on the dialog ID and returns the last few records. 

**Note**:
- When using MessageModel for database operations, you need to ensure that the input parameter type matches the defined field type.
- Although `meta_data`the default value is an empty dictionary for fields, JSON data with arbitrary structures can be stored as needed. 
- When performing database operations such as adding, querying, and updating records, you should ensure that the operations are performed in the correct database session context.

**Example output**:
Since MessageModel is a data model class, it does not directly produce output on its own. However, when it is instantiated and used for database operations, such as`add_message_to_db` adding a new chat via a function, it may return a chat ID like this:
```
'1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef'
```
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of this function is to generate and return a string representing the message object. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code Description**: `__repr__` A method is a special method that defines the "official" string representation of an object. In this concrete implementation, it returns a formatted string that contains several properties of the message object, including:`id` , `conversation_id`, `chat_type`, `query` `response` `meta_data` `feedback_score` `feedback_reason` `create_time` These properties  are `self` accessed by using the keyword to indicate that they are instance variables of the object. Strings are formatted using f-string, a string formatting mechanism introduced in Python 3.6 and later that allows the value of an expression to be embedded directly into a string constant. 

**Note**: `__repr__` The return value of the method should return an unambiguous representation of the object as much as possible for easy debugging and logging. The returned string should try to follow the conventions of Python object representation, i.e `<type(name=value, ...)>` . the format of . Also, while this method is primarily used for debugging and development, it can also be used for logging or other scenarios that require object string representation. 

**Example output**: Suppose you have a message object with the following property values:`id=1` , `conversation_id=2`, `chat_type='group'`, `query='天气如何'` `response='晴朗'` `meta_data='{}'` `feedback_score=5` `feedback_reason='准确'`. `create_time='2023-04-01 12:00:00'` Calling a method on this object `__repr__` will return the following string:

```
<message(id='1', conversation_id='2', chat_type='group', query='天气如何', response='晴朗',meta_data='{}',feedback_score='5',feedback_reason='准确', create_time='2023-04-01 12:00:00')>
```

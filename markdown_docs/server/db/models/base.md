## ClassDef BaseModel
**BaseModel**: The function of a BaseModel is to provide an infrastructure for a database model. 

**Properties**:
- `id`: Primary key ID, which is used to uniquely identify each record.
- `create_time`: The time when the record was created.
- `update_time`: The last time the record was updated.
- `create_by`: The creator of the record.
- `update_by`: Last updated by the record.

**Code Description**:
The BaseModel class defines the infrastructure of a database model and contains several common and important fields. These fields include:
- `id` Fields are defined using `Column` a function of type and `Integer`are set as the primary key() with`primary_key=True` index() enabled`index=True`, in order to improve query efficiency. In addition, the field has a comment()`comment="主键ID"` that explains the purpose of the field. 
- `create_time` The field records when the data was created and is of type `DateTime` . The default value for this field is `datetime.utcnow` set via the function to ensure that the UTC time at the time the record was created is used. This field also has a comment (`comment="创建时间"`). 
- `update_time` The field records when the data was last updated, and is of type `DateTime`. The difference is that its default value is set to `None` , and with  the `onupdate=datetime.utcnow` parameter setting, this field is automatically updated to the current UTC time when the record is updated. The field also has a corresponding comment (`comment="更新时间"`). 
- `create_by` The and `update_by` fields are used to record information about the creator and last updater of the data, both of which are of type `String`. The default value is  , `None`and each has a corresponding comment (`comment="创建者"` and  ) `comment="更新者"`to explain the purpose of the field. 

**Note**:
- When using BaseModel, it is important to note that`create_time` the sum `update_time`field defaults to UTC time, which means that if the application is running in a different time zone, it may be necessary to do a corresponding time zone conversion. 
- `id`Fields are set as primary keys and indexes, which are important for database performance optimization. Make sure that each model has a unique identifier.
- `create_by`The  default values for `update_by` the  and  fields are , `None`and in practice, depending on your business needs, you may need to explicitly set the values of these fields when data is created or updated.

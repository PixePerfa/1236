## ClassDef KnowledgeBaseModel
**KnowledgeBaseModel**: The function of the KnowledgeBaseModel class is to define the data model of the knowledge base, which is used to store and manage information about the knowledge base in the database. 

**Properties**:
- `id`: The ID of the knowledge base, which is the unique identifier of each knowledge base.
- `kb_name`: The name of the knowledge base, which is used to identify and retrieve a specific knowledge base.
- `kb_info`: An introduction to the knowledge base, which provides basic information about the knowledge base and is used by the agent.
- `vs_type`: Vector library type, specifies the type of vector library used by the knowledge base.
- `embed_model`: Embedding model name, specifying the embedding model to be used for the knowledge base.
- `file_count`: Number of files, which records the number of files contained in the knowledge base.
- `create_time`: Creation time, which records the time when the knowledge base was created.

**Code Description**:
The KnowledgeBaseModel class, which inherits from the Base class, is an ORM model that maps tables in a database `knowledge_base` . This class defines the basic properties of the knowledge base, including the knowledge base ID, name, introduction, vector library type, embedding model name, number of files, and creation time. These attributes allow you to efficiently store and manage information about your knowledge base in a database. 

In the project, the KnowledgeBaseModel class is called by multiple functions to implement the addition, deletion, search and modification of the knowledge base. For example, `add_kb_to_db` in a function, use the KnowledgeBaseModel to create a new knowledge base instance or update information for an existing knowledge base. In the `list_kbs_from_db` function, query the KnowledgeBaseModel to get a list of knowledge bases that meet specific criteria. In addition,`kb_exists` functions such as ,`load_kb_from_db` ,`delete_kb_from_db` , and  are `get_kb_detail` also involved in the operation of the KnowledgeBaseModel class to check the existence of the knowledge base, load the knowledge base information, delete the knowledge base, and obtain the knowledge base details. 

**Note**:
When using the KnowledgeBaseModel class for database operations, care needs to be taken to ensure that the parameter types and values passed in conform to the defined attribute types and business logic requirements to avoid data type errors or logical errors. 

**Example output**:
Suppose you have a knowledge base instance in your database with the following property values:
```
<KnowledgeBase(id='1', kb_name='技术文档库', kb_intro='存储技术相关文档', vs_type='ElasticSearch', embed_model='BERT', file_count='100', create_time='2023-04-01 12:00:00')>
```
This means that there is a knowledge base with ID 1, the name is "Technical Documentation Library", the introduction is "Storing Technical Related Documents", the vector library type used is ElasticSearch, the embedding model is BERT, contains 100 files, and was created on April 1, 2023 at 12 o'clock.
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__The function of the repr__**: __repr__ function is to provide an official string representation of the KnowledgeBaseModel object. 

**Parameters**: This function does not accept extra arguments, it only uses self to access the properties of the object. 

**Code Description**: 
`__repr__`The method is defined in the KnowledgeBaseModel class and is used to generate an official string representation of the object. This string represents key information about the object, making it easier for developers and debuggers to identify the object. Specifically, it returns a formatted string that contains several property values for the KnowledgeBaseModel object, including:
- `id`: A unique identifier for an object.
- `kb_name`: The name of the knowledge base.
- `kb_info`: An introduction to the knowledge base.
- `vs_type`: The version type of the knowledge base.
- `embed_model`: The name of the embedded model.
- `file_count`: The number of Chinese parts in the knowledge base.
- `create_time`: The time when the knowledge base was created.

This method embeds object properties into a predefined string template by formatting a string by f-string, resulting in an easy-to-read and understandable representation.

**Note**:
- `__repr__`Methods are typically used for debugging and logging, and they should return an unambiguous and unambiguous representation of the object.
- In Python, when you try to convert an object to a string (e.g. using`str()` a function or when printing), if no method is defined`__str__`, Python falls back to using`__repr__` a method. 
- Ensure that `__repr__`the string returned by the method contains enough information to be used to identify key information in the object. 

**Example output**:
```python
<KnowledgeBase(id='1', kb_name='MyKnowledgeBase',kb_intro='This is a test knowledge base vs_type='v1.0', embed_model='BERT', file_count='100', create_time='2023-04-01')>
```
This example shows the possible form of a method return value for a KnowledgeBaseModel object`__repr__`, which contains the values of the object's id, kb_name, kb_intro, vs_type, embed_model, file_count, and create_time attributes.

## ClassDef SummaryChunkModel
**SummaryChunkModel**: The function of the SummaryChunkModel class is to store and manage summary information for each document identifier (doc_id) in the document. 

**Properties**:
- `id`: A unique identifier that identifies the ID of each summary information.
- `kb_name`: The name of the knowledge base, which indicates which knowledge base the summary information belongs to.
- `summary_context`: Summarizes text, stores auto-generated or user-entered summaries of documents.
- `summary_id`: Summarize the vector ID for subsequent vector library construction and semantic association.
- `doc_ids`: A list of vector library IDs that stores a list of document identifiers associated with that summary.
- `meta_data`: Metadata, which stores additional information in JSON format, such as page number information, etc.

**Code Description**:
The SummaryChunkModel class defines a data model for storing summary information about a document. The model includes basic information about the document such as the knowledge base name, summary text, summary vector ID, a list of related document IDs, and additional metadata. This information is mainly derived from the description of the file when the user uploads it or the summary generated by the program automatically slicing the document. In addition, the model also supports subsequent vector library construction and semantic association tasks, which are achieved by creating summary_context indexes and calculating semantic similarity. 

In a project, the SummaryChunkModel is called by several functions in the knowledge_metadata_repository.py file, including adding, removing, listing, and counting summary information in the knowledge base. These functions manage the summary information in the database by manipulating the SummaryChunkModel instance, such as adding new summary information, deleting summary information for a specific knowledge base, listing summary information based on the knowledge base name, and counting the number of summaries for a specific knowledge base.

**Note**:
- When using the SummaryChunkModel for database operations, you need to make sure that the parameters passed in are of the correct type and format, especially the `meta_data` field, which should be stored in the correct JSON format. 
- When performing vector library construction and semantic association tasks, you should pay attention to `summary_id` `doc_ids` the correct use and association of and fields. 

**Example output**:
Suppose there is an instance of summary information in the database, which might be represented as follows:
```
<SummaryChunk(id='1', kb_name='技术文档', summary_context='这是一个关于AI技术的摘要', doc_ids='["doc1", "doc2"]', metadata='{}')>
```
This indicates a summary message with ID 1 that belongs to the "Technical Documentation" knowledge base, with the summary text "This is a summary of AI technology", the associated document identifiers are doc1 and doc2, and there is no additional metadata information.
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of this function is to generate and return a string representing the state of the object. 

**Parameters**: This function does not accept `self`any arguments other than that. 

**Code Description**: `__repr__`A function is `SummaryChunkModel`a special method of a class that creates a string that represents the state of an instance of that object. This string contains`SummaryChunkModel` several key properties of the instance:`id` , ,`kb_name` ,`summary_context` `doc_ids`,`metadata` These properties are displayed by accessing the corresponding properties of the instance and formatting them into a string of a specific format. This string format follows`<SummaryChunk(id='...', kb_name='...', summary_context='...', doc_ids='...', metadata='...')>` a form where each `...`is replaced by the actual value of the corresponding property of the instance. This representation allows developers to quickly identify the state of an object during debugging. 

**Note**: `__repr__`Methods are typically used for debugging and logging, and it should return a clear and easy-to-understand description of the state of the object. The returned string should reflect as closely as possible the key properties of the object. In addition, while`__repr__` the primary purpose is not to be directly seen by the end user, it should be designed to ensure that sufficient information is provided to identify the specific state of the object when needed. 

**Output example**: Suppose there is an`SummaryChunkModel` instance`id` that is`123`, `kb_name`for`"KnowledgeBase1"`, `summary_context`for`"Context1"`, `doc_ids`for`"doc1, doc2"`, `metadata`for`"{'author': 'John Doe'}"`. Calling a method for this instance`__repr__` will return the following string:

```
<SummaryChunk(id='123', kb_name='KnowledgeBase1', summary_context='Context1', doc_ids='doc1, doc2', metadata='{'author': 'John Doe'}')>
```

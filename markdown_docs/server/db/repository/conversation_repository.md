Next, the function creates an `ConversationModel`instance that contains information such as the ID, chat type, and name of the chat history. Then, `session.add(c)`by adding this instance to the database session, prepare to save it to the database. Finally, the function returns the ID of the newly created chat.

This shows the`ConversationModel` important role that is used to process chat history data in the project. 

**Note**:

- `chat_type`The parameter is required because it defines the type of chat history, which is very important for subsequent data processing and querying.
- If it is not provided when the function is called`conversation_id`, one is automatically generated. This means that each chat will have a unique identifier, even if the ID is not explicitly specified.

## FunctionDef search_knowledge_base_iter(database, query)
**search_knowledge_base_iter**: This function is used to search the knowledge base asynchronously and iteratively to get relevant answers. 

**Parameters**:
- `database`: The name of the knowledge base, of type String.
- `query`: The user's query statement, of type String.

**Code Description**:
`search_knowledge_base_iter` A function is an asynchronous function that takes two arguments:`database` and `query`. This function first calls `knowledge_base_chat` the function, sends a query request to the specified knowledge base, and sets a series of parameters such as the model name, temperature value, history, top_k value of the vector search, the maximum number of tokens, the prompt name, the score threshold, and whether it is output as a stream. These parameters are set to precisely control the behavior of knowledge base search and answer generation. 

Inside the function, the `response.body_iterator`data returned by each piece is processed through asynchronous iteration. Each piece of data is assumed to be a JSON string that contains information about the answer and related documentation. The function parses the JSON data, extracts the answers, and stitches them together. At the same time, the information about the relevant documents is processed, but in the current code implementation, the document information(s)`docs` is extracted and not used further. 

**Note**:
- When using this function, you need to make sure that `database` the knowledge inventory specified by the parameter is there, otherwise you may not be able to get the answer properly. 
- Since asynchronous operations are involved inside the function, you need to use keywords when calling this function `await` . 
- The function returns a spliced answer, and may need to be modified appropriately if you need more detailed information, such as related documentation.

**Example output**:
 `search_knowledge_base_iter` An example of what might be returned by calling the function:
```json
"This is an answer generated based on your query."
```
This example of output shows only a portion of the answer. The actual content of the answers returned will vary depending on the query statement and the contents of the knowledge base.

### ClassDef Config
**Config**: The function of the Config class is to define a strict configuration object model. 

**Properties**:
- `extra`: Controls how extra fields are handled.
- `arbitrary_types_allowed`: Allows the use of any type of field.

**Code Description**:
The Config class is a configuration object that is defined using the Pydantic library. Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library that allows developers to define data structures in a standard Python type prompt manner, while providing powerful data validation capabilities. 

In this Config class, two key configuration items are set:

1. `extra = Extra.forbid`: This setting specifies that an error will be thrown if the incoming data contains fields that are not declared by the model. This is a rigorous way of validating data, ensuring the purity and consistency of data objects and preventing accidental data from being accepted.

2. `arbitrary_types_allowed = True`: This setting allows model fields to use any type. By default, Pydantic requires all field types to be standard Python or Pydantic-defined types. By enabling this option, developers can use more flexible type definitions, such as custom classes or other complex data structures.

**Note**:
- When using the Config class, you need to pay attention to the balance between the rigor of the data and the flexibility of the type. While allowing any type can provide more flexibility, it can also increase the complexity of data processing.
- In practice, the decision to enable the option should be based on your specific needs `arbitrary_types_allowed` . If you use a large number of custom types in your project, it may be beneficial to enable this option. Conversely, if your project primarily uses standard types, you may not need to enable this option. 
- `extra = Extra.forbid` makes the Config class ideal for scenarios that require high data consistency and security. Developers should take this into account when designing APIs or data interfaces.

### FunctionDef raise_deprecation(cls, values)
**raise_deprecation**: The function of this function is to warn when an LLMKnowledgeChain is instantiated using a deprecated way, and automatically convert to the recommended instantiation method if appropriate. 

**Parameters**:
- `cls`: The first argument of the class method, which refers to the current class.
- `values`: A dictionary containing the parameters passed in when instantiating the LLMKnowledgeChain.

**Code Description**:
This function checks if `values`the dictionary contains a key`llm`. If present, a warning will first be issued informing the user that `llm`instantiating LLMKnowledgeChain directly with parameters has been deprecated, and suggesting`llm_chain` instantiation with arguments or`from_llm` class methods. Then, if `values`the key does not exist and`llm_chain` the `llm`value of the key is not there`None`, the function`values` takes `prompt`the value of the key from it (or uses the default prompt if it doesn't`PROMPT`) and creates an instance with `llm`the value of and`prompt` `LLMChain`assigns it to it`values`Keys in the dictionary`llm_chain`. Finally, the function returns an updated`values` dictionary. 

**Note**:
- When using this function, you should make sure that the `values`value corresponding to the key (if present) in the incoming dictionary is expected, as the function creates an instance based on that value`llm``LLMChain`. 
- After calling this function, you should check the returned `values`dictionary to confirm that the instantiation parameters have been updated as recommended. 

**Example output**:
Assuming that the dictionary passed in`values` is `{"llm": some_llm_object, "prompt": "Example prompt"}`, and `PROMPT`it is the default prompt, the dictionary that the function may return`values` is:
```
{
    "llm": some_llm_object,
    "prompt": "Example prompt",
    "llm_chain": LLMChain(llm=some_llm_object, prompt="Example prompt")
}
```
In this example, a `llm_chain`key is added to a dictionary with a value of an object that is used`some_llm_object` and `"Example prompt"`instantiated`LLMChain`.

### FunctionDef input_keys(self)
**input_keys**: The function of this function is to return a list of individual input keys. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Function Description**: `input_keys` A function is a private method designed for internal use and is not recommended to be called directly outside of the class. Its main purpose is to provide a list of individual elements that are the property values of this instance `input_key` . This method may exist to align the interface with other methods that need to return multiple keys, or to make room for future expansion. 

**Note**: Since this method is marked as private (via `:meta private:` annotation), it is primarily used for the internal logic of the class, not as part of the class's public interface. Therefore, caution should be exercised when calling this method outside of the class, as its behavior or signature may change in future versions without any guarantee of backward compatibility. 

**Example output**:
```python
['example_input_key']
```
In this example, assuming that the instance's `input_key` property is set to `'example_input_key'` , then calling  the method `input_keys` will return a list of strings only `'example_input_key'` . 
***
### FunctionDef output_keys(self)
**output_keys**: The function of this function is to return a list of output keys. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code description**: `output_keys`A function is `LLMKnowledgeChain`a method of a class, and it is marked as a private method, meaning that it is primarily intended for internal use by the class, rather than being designed for external calls. The purpose of this method is to provide a list of individual output keys. Here`self.output_key` is `LLMKnowledgeChain`a property of the class, and this method provides access to the output key by wrapping that property back in a list. This design allows for future scalability, for example, if multiple output keys need to be returned, they can be adjusted without changing the method signature. 

**Note**: Since this method is marked as private (via `:meta private:`markup), it is primarily used for the internal logic of the class, and it is not recommended to call this method directly outside of the class. When using it, it should be noted that although it currently returns a list of single output keys, it is designed to allow multiple keys to be returned, which means that possible future changes should be taken into account when processing the return values. 

**Example output**:
```python
['output_key_value']
```
In this example, the value of the property `output_key_value`is represented`self.output_key`. The actual value will depend on the value assigned `LLMKnowledgeChain`to the property by the instance during its lifetime`self.output_key`. 
***
### FunctionDef _evaluate_expression(self, dataset, query)
**_evaluate_expression**: The function of this function is to asynchronously search the knowledge base and return search results based on a given dataset and query statement. 

**Parameters**:
- `dataset`: The name of the dataset, of type String. It specifies the knowledge base to be searched.
- `query`: A query statement of type String. It is a question or keyword that users want to search for in the knowledge base.

**Code Description**:
`_evaluate_expression` The function first attempts to call `search_knowledge_base_iter` the function to search the knowledge base asynchronously. The function receives two parameters:`dataset` and  , `query`which represent the name of the knowledge base and the user's query statement, respectively. If the search is successful, the`search_knowledge_base_iter` function will return the results of the search; If any exceptions are encountered during the search (for example, a knowledge base does not exist or a query statement is incorrect), they are caught and the output is set to Incorrect information entered or knowledge base does not exist. Eventually, the function returns search results or error messages. 

**Note**:
- Before you call this function, you need to make sure that the provided `dataset`(knowledge base name) is present, otherwise it may cause the search to fail. 
- Since  is `search_knowledge_base_iter` an asynchronous function, the`_evaluate_expression` function internally uses `asyncio.run` to  run it. This means that  the `_evaluate_expression` function itself is synchronous, but it performs asynchronous operations internally. 

**Example output**:
 `_evaluate_expression` An example of what might be returned by calling the function:
```
This is an answer generated based on your query."
```
This example shows what a simple answer looks like. The actual content returned will vary depending on the query statement and the contents of the knowledge base. If you encounter an error, you may return:
```
"The entered information is incorrect or does not exist in the knowledge base"
```
This indicates that the information provided is incorrect, or that the specified knowledge base does not exist.
***
### FunctionDef _process_llm_result(self, llm_output, llm_input, run_manager)
**_process_llm_result**: The function of this function is to process the output of the language model and return a formatted answer. 

**Parameters**:
- `llm_output`: A string type that represents the raw output of the language model.
- `llm_input`: A string type that represents the original input passed to the Language model.
- `run_manager`: type, `CallbackManagerForChainRun`which is used to manage the execution of callback functions. 

**Code Description**:
`_process_llm_result` The function first `run_manager` `on_text` outputs the raw output of the language model in green text via the method of , and sets whether or not to output in detail. Next, the function attempts to match the text chunks in the output with a regular expression. If the match is successful, the text block content is extracted and the function is called `_evaluate_expression` to process this part of the content and the original input to generate the final answer. If the original output starts with "Answer:", or contains "Answer:", it is directly taken as an answer. If none of the above conditions are met, an error message is returned stating that the input format is incorrect. Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the processed answer or error message. 

**Note**:
- `_process_llm_result` Functions rely on `_evaluate_expression` functions to process the extracted text block content. Therefore, ensuring that `_evaluate_expression` the  function executes correctly is a prerequisite for using this function. 
- The output format processed by this function is specific to the output structure of the language model, so you may need to adjust the regular expression or processing logic in different model outputs.
- The keys contained in the dictionary returned by the function are determined by `self.output_key` ,  which means that you need to make sure that  has `self.output_key` been set correctly before using this function. 

**Example output**:
 `_process_llm_result` One example of what might be returned by calling the function:
```
{"output_key": "Answer:This is an answer generated based on your query."}
```
If you enter an incorrect format, you may return:
```
{"output_key": "The input format is wrong: original language model output content"}
```
This example shows how a function can return different processing results depending on the situation. The actual content returned will vary depending on the output of the language model and the processing logic of the input.

### FunctionDef _chain_type(self)
**Function name**: _chain_type

**Function function**: Returns a string representation of the chain type. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code Description**: `_chain_type`A function is `LLMKnowledgeChain`a private method of a class that returns a string representing the type of the chain. In this context, the chain type is defined as a fixed one`"llm_knowledge_chain"`, which means that the string returned by the function is used to identify or represent a chain of knowledge based on the Long-term Language Model (LLM). This type of knowledge chain may involve the use of large language models to process and link information in the knowledge base. Since this is a private method, it is primarily used`LLMKnowledgeChain` inside the class and may be used for logging, debugging, or other methods of the class to differentiate between different types of knowledge chains. 

**Note**: Since `_chain_type`it is a private method, it should not be called directly from outside the instance of the class. It is designed for internal use by classes to provide a consistent way to reference chain types. If you need to get chain type information outside of the class, you should do so through the public interface or method provided by the class. 

**Example output**: Calling `_chain_type`a method will return a string`"llm_knowledge_chain"`. 
***
### FunctionDef from_llm(cls, llm, prompt)
**from_llm**: The function of this function is to create a chain of knowledge object from the language model. 

**Parameters**:
- `cls`: A traditional argument to a class method that represents the class itself to be instantiated.
- `llm`: `BaseLanguageModel`Type, which represents the language model to be used. 
- `prompt`: `BasePromptTemplate`Type, which defaults to`PROMPT`, represents the prompt template used for the Language model. 
- `**kwargs`: Accepts any additional keyword arguments to which the`LLMKnowledgeChain` constructor will be passed. 

**Code Description**:
`from_llm`A function is `LLMKnowledgeChain`a class method of a class that accepts a language model instance`llm` and an optional prompt template `prompt`as input. This function starts by creating an instance using the provided language model and prompt template`LLMChain`. It then uses this `LLMChain`instance and any other provided keyword arguments to create and return an`LLMKnowledgeChain` instance. This process allows objects to `LLMKnowledgeChain`be instantiated directly from a language model, simplifying the process of using language models for knowledge search and processing. 

In a project, a`from_llm` function is `search_knowledgebase_once`called by a function. In this call,`model` (a Language Model instance) and `PROMPT`(a prompt template) are passed to`from_llm`, along with being passed `verbose=True`as keyword arguments. This indicates that when the instance is created`LLMKnowledgeChain`, verbose mode is enabled.  The `search_knowledgebase_once`function then uses the returned `LLMKnowledgeChain`instance to perform a search for a given query, showing how methods can be leveraged`from_llm` to process and search for knowledge in a real-world application. 

**Note**:
- Make sure that`from_llm` the`llm` argument passed to is a valid `BaseLanguageModel`instance to guarantee that the knowledge chain is built and manipulated correctly. 
- When using `**kwargs`passing extra parameters, you should ensure that these parameters are`LLMKnowledgeChain` supported by the constructor to avoid runtime errors. 

**Example output**:
Since `from_llm`an instance is returned`LLMKnowledgeChain`, the output example will depend on the `LLMKnowledgeChain`specific implementation of the class and the parameters passed at initialization. Suppose`LLMKnowledgeChain` there is a method `run`that accepts a query and returns a relevant answer, an example of a possible use might be as follows:
```python
llm_knowledge_chain = LLMKnowledgeChain.from_llm(model, prompt=PROMPT, verbose=True)
answer = llm_knowledge_chain.run("This is an example query")
print(answer)  # The output will show the answer to the query
```

## FunctionDef search_knowledgebase_once(query)
Doc is waiting to be generated...
## ClassDef KnowledgeSearchInput
**KnowledgeSearchInput**: The function of the KnowledgeSearchInput class is to define an input model for searching the knowledge base. 

**Properties**:
- location: Represents the query string to be searched.

**Code Description**:
The KnowledgeSearchInput class inherits from BaseModel, which indicates that it is a model class that defines data structures. In this class, a property called is defined`location` that stores the query string to be searched in the knowledge base. By using`Field` a function, a `location`property is provided with descriptive information, "The query to be searched", which helps to understand the purpose of the property. 

The role of this class in a project is to serve as an input data model for search knowledge base operations. It defines the necessary input fields (in this case, the query location) so that the rest of the code can build search requests based on those inputs. Although there is no direct example of a call in the information provided, it can be inferred that an instance of this class will be created and populated with the corresponding search query, which will then be passed to the function or method that performs the search operation.

**Note**:
- When using the KnowledgeSearchInput class, you need to make sure that the `location`property is assigned correctly, as it is required to perform the search operation. 
- Since this class inherits from BaseModel, you can take advantage of the data validation capabilities provided by the Pydantic library to ensure the validity of the input data. For example, if there is a requirement for a specific format or range of values, you can do so by modifying the parameters of the Field function.
- In practice, the KnowledgeSearchInput class may need to be extended to add more properties and validation logic according to the specific structure and search requirements of the knowledge base.

## FunctionDef search_engine_iter(query)
**search_engine_iter**: This function is used to asynchronously retrieve the content of a query through a specified search engine and generate relevant answers. 

**Parameters**:
- `query`: The query entered by the user, of type as a string.

**Code Description**:
`search_engine_iter`A function is an asynchronous function that is primarily used to handle query requests from users. It first calls `search_engine_chat`a function that sends a query request to the specified search engine (in this case, Bing) and sets a series of parameters, including the model name, temperature value, history, number of returned results, maximum number of tokens, prompt name, and whether or not to return results as a stream. These parameters are set to optimize the relevance and quality of search results. 

After the call, the function traverses the response body `search_engine_chat`through an asynchronous iterater`response.body_iterator`. The data returned for each iteration is a JSON string containing the answers and related documents returned by the search engine. The function parses these JSON strings, extracts the answer and document information, and adds the answer content to`contents` the variables. 

Ultimately, the function returns the summed `contents`variables, which are strings containing all relevant answers. 

**Note**:
- The function is asynchronous, so it needs to be called with`await` a keyword or in an asynchronous environment. 
- The execution of functions depends on external search engine services and LLM models, so the execution time can be affected by network conditions and service response times.
- Before using this function, you need to make sure that the corresponding search engine API key and LLM model have been configured.

**Example output**:
```json
"Based on your query, here are the generated answers."
```
This output example shows what the answer might be returned by the function. The actual content returned will vary depending on the content of the query and the results returned by the search engine.
## FunctionDef search_internet(query)
**search_internet**: This function is used to call the search engine asynchronously to retrieve the content queried by the user. 

**Parameters**:
- `query`: The query entered by the user, of type as a string.

**Code Description**:
`search_internet`A function is a concise interface that triggers an internet search for a specified query. It is implemented by calling `search_engine_iter`a function, which is an asynchronous function that is responsible for specific search operations and processing logic. In`search_internet` a function, `asyncio.run`a method is used to run `search_engine_iter`the function, which allows the asynchronous function to be conveniently called in synchronous code and wait for its result. 

`search_engine_iter`The function describes the search process in detail, including sending a request to the search engine, processing the returned data, and finally returning the accumulated answer content as a string. This process involves knowledge of asynchronous programming, especially asynchronous iteration when handling network requests and responses.

**Note**:
- Since `search_internet`the function is used internally`asyncio.run`, it should not be used in an asynchronous function or event loop that is already running to avoid throwing exceptions. 
- The execution efficiency and result quality of functions depend on the response speed and accuracy of external search engines, so when the network is not in good condition or the search engine service is unstable, it may affect the user experience.
- Before using it, make sure that the relevant search engine API keys and configurations are set up correctly to ensure that the search function works properly.

**Example output**:
Suppose the user queries "Python asynchronous programming", an example of a string that a function might return is:
```
"Python asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm designed to improve the concurrency and performance of programs. Here are some basic knowledge and practical guidelines about asynchronous programming in Python."
```
This example shows what a function might return to an answer, which will vary depending on the query and the results returned by the search engine.
## ClassDef SearchInternetInput
**SearchInternetInput**: The function of the SearchInternetInput class is to define an input model for Internet searches. 

**Properties**:
- location: The query string used for internet searches.

**Code Description**:
The SearchInternetInput class inherits from BaseModel, which means that it is a model class that is typically used to handle validation, serialization, and deserialization of data. In this class, a property called is defined`location` that stores the query string that the user wishes to search for. By using a function from the Pydantic library`Field`, a `location`descriptive text is provided for the property, "Query for Internet search", which helps to understand the purpose of the property. 

The role of this class in the project is to serve as an input data model for the search Internet function. It is designed to allow developers to provide the necessary input information in a structured manner, i.e., what the user wants to search for, when calling search Internet-related functions. This approach improves the readability and ease of use of the code, as well as facilitates subsequent data validation and processing.

From the project structure, although`server/agent/tools/__init__.py` `server/agent/tools_select.py`there is no direct mention of the use of the SearchInternetInput class in the two files, it can be inferred that the SearchInternetInput class may be called by the part of the project that is responsible for handling search requests. Specifically, a developer might instantiate the SearchInternetInput class in a function or method that handles a search request, then construct a location property based on the user's input, and then use this instance to perform the search operation. 

**Note**:
- When using the SearchInternetInput class, developers need to ensure that the `location`value provided is a valid search query string, as this will directly affect the relevance and accuracy of the search results. 
- Considering the need for data validation, developers should be familiar with the basic usage of the Pydantic library when using this class in order to take advantage of features such as model validation.

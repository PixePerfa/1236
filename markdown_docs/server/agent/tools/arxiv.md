## FunctionDef arxiv(query)
**arxiv**: This function is used to perform query operations on Arxiv. 

**Parameters**:
- **query**: A string type that represents the content of the query to be executed on Arxiv. 

**Code Description**:
`arxiv`A function is a simple but powerful interface for executing queries in an Arxiv database. It first creates an`ArxivQueryRun` instance and then calls the instance's `run`methods to execute the query. The exact content of the query is specified by `query`a parameter, which should be a string that represents the keyword or query expression that the user wants to search for on Arxiv. 

In the project structure,`arxiv` functions are located`server/agent/tools/arxiv.py` under the path and are `arxiv.py`one of the core functions defined in the module. Although there are no direct call examples in other parts of the current project, such as`server/agent/tools/__init__.py` `server/agent/tools_select.py`and , it can be inferred that `arxiv`the function is designed to be called by these modules or other parts of the project to implement query functionality against the Arxiv database. 

**Note**:
- When using `arxiv`functions, you need to make sure that the query string passed in `query`is valid, i.e. it should conform to Arxiv's query syntax and requirements. 
- The execution result of this function depends on`ArxivQueryRun` the implementation of the class's `run`method, so you need to ensure that the method can correctly handle the incoming query string and return the desired query result. 

**Example output**:
Let's say `arxiv`the call to the function is as follows:
```python
result = arxiv("deep learning")
```
The function might return an object that contains the results of the query, such as a list of papers on deep learning. The exact format of the return value will depend on`ArxivQueryRun` the implementation details of the class's`run` methods. 
## ClassDef ArxivInput
**ArxivInput**: The function of the ArxivInput class is to define an input model for search queries. 

**Properties**:
- query: A string that represents the title of the search query.

**Code Description**:
The ArxivInput class inherits from BaseModel, which means that it is a model class that defines data structures. In this class, a property called Attribute is defined`query`, which is a string type that stores the title of the user's search query. By using`Field` a function, a description is provided for `query`the property, "The search query title", which helps to understand the purpose of the property. 

In the project, the ArxivInput class is used as a data model to handle search queries related to arXiv. Although there is no direct example of the code invocation case provided, it can be inferred that this class may be used`server/agent/tools` in other modules in the directory as an input parameter to receive user search requests. This design makes the code more modular, easy to maintain and extendable. 

**Note**:
- When using the ArxivInput class, you need to make sure that the argument you pass in `query`is a valid string, as it will directly affect the relevance and accuracy of the search results. 
- Since ArxivInput inherits from BaseModel, you can use the data validation function provided by the Pydantic library to ensure the legitimacy of the input data.
- Considering that the ArxivInput class may be used for network requests, care should be taken to address potential security issues, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, to ensure that user input is properly cleaned and validated.

## FunctionDef wolfram(query)
**wolfram**: The function of this function is to execute a query to the Wolfram Alpha API and return the results. 

**Parameters**:
- `query`: The type of string that represents what you want to query.

**Code Description**:
`wolfram`The function first creates an `WolframAlphaAPIWrapper`object, which is a wrapper around the Wolfram Alpha API. When you create this object, you need to provide one`wolfram_alpha_appid`, which is the application ID required to call the Wolfram Alpha service. Subsequently, the function uses the`run` method to execute the incoming query`query`. Finally, the function returns the query results. 

In a project, `wolfram`a function is part `server/agent/tools/wolfram.py`of a module, and while the circumstances of its call are not directly described in the documentation provided, it can be inferred that the function may have been designed as a utility function that can be called by other parts of the project to obtain the results of a Wolfram alpha query. This makes it easy for other modules in the project to take advantage of the powerful computation and knowledge query capabilities provided by Wolfram Alpha without having to worry about the specifics of API calls. 

**Note**:
- Before using this function, you need to make sure that you have obtained a valid Wolfram Alpha Application ID()`wolfram_alpha_appid` and that it is correctly configured when creating the`WolframAlphaAPIWrapper` object. 
- The exact format and content of the query results will depend on the return value of the Wolfram Alpha API, which may include text, images, or other data types.

**Example output**:
Assuming a query "2+2" is performed on Wolfram Alpha, the function might return something like this:
```
4
```
This is just a simplified example, and the actual results returned may contain more information and data types, depending on the content of the query and the response of the Wolfram Alpha API.
## ClassDef WolframInput
**WolframInput**: The function of the WolframInput class is to encapsulate input data for computation in the Wolfram Language. 

**Properties**:
- location: A string that represents the specific issue that needs to be calculated.

**Code Description**:
The WolframInput class inherits from BaseModel, indicating that it is a model class for data validation and serialization. In this class, a property called`location` Properties is defined that stores a string that represents a specific problem that needs to be computed using the Wolfram Language. By using functions from the Pydantic library`Field`, `location`a description is provided for the property, enhancing the readability and ease of use of the code. 

In the structure of the project, the WolframInput class is located in `server/agent/tools/wolfram.py`a file, which means that it is part of the server-side proxy tool that is specifically designed to handle input data related to the Wolfram Language. Although`server/agent/tools/__init__.py` the `server/agent/tools_select.py`invocation of the WolframInput class is not directly mentioned in the information provided and in the two files, it can be speculated that the WolframInput class may be used by code in these or other related modules to facilitate the handling and delivery of problems that need to be solved in the Wolfram Language. 

**Note**:
- When using the WolframInput class, you need to make sure that `location`the problem description in the properties is accurate and valid, as this will directly affect the results of the Wolfram Language computation. 
- Since the WolframInput class inherits from BaseModel, you can take advantage of the data validation capabilities provided by Pydantic to ensure the validity of the input data. In practice, the WolframInput class can be extended as needed to add more properties and validation logic to meet different computational needs.

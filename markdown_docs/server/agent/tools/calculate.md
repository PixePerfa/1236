## ClassDef CalculatorInput
**CalculatorInput**: The function of the CalculatorInput class is to define the data structure of the calculator input. 

**Properties**:
- `query`: A string that represents a calculator query and is a required field.

**Code Description**:
The CalculatorInput class inherits from BaseModel, which indicates that it was created using the Pydantic library for data validation and setup. In this class, a property is defined`query`, which is a field of type string. By using `Field()`a function, we can add additional validation or descriptive information to this field, although it is not shown in the current code sample. The primary role of this class is to serve as an input data model for the calculator service, ensuring that incoming queries are valid and in the expected format of strings. 

From the project structure, the CalculatorInput class is located in a `server/agent/tools/calculate.py`file, but there is no direct code example of how this class can be called by other objects in the project information provided. However, based on its definition and location, we can infer that the CalculatorInput class may be used to handle`server/agent/tools` computational requests from other modules in the directory. For example, it might be used to validate and parse user inputs, which are then passed to the logic that actually performs the computation. 

**Note**:
- When using the CalculatorInput class, you need to make sure that the field you pass in`query` is a valid string, as this is necessary before you can perform the calculation. 
- Since CalculatorInput uses the Pydantic library, developers need to be familiar with the basics of using Pydantic in order to properly define and use the data model.
- While the current CalculatorInput class is relatively simple to define, developers can extend it by adding more fields or using the more advanced validation capabilities provided by Pydantic, depending on their needs.
## FunctionDef calculate(query)
**calculate**: The function of this function is to perform mathematical calculation queries. 

**Parameters**:
- `query`: A string type that represents a mathematical query statement that needs to be evaluated.

**Code Description**:
`calculate` A function is a function that is used to perform mathematical calculations. It first `model_container`takes an instance of the model from which it is assumed to be loaded and ready to process math computation queries. Next, use the`LLMMathChain.from_llm` method to create an`LLMMathChain` instance that can handle mathematical calculations using the provided model(`model`). When you create an `LLMMathChain`instance, you pass in a model and a flag`verbose=True` along with a hint `PROMPT`that indicates that there will be more detailed output information when the calculation is performed. Finally, by calling`LLMMathChain` the method of the instance`run`, the user's query () is passed in`query`, the actual calculation is performed, and the result of the calculation is returned. 

In a project, although`server/agent/tools/__init__.py` the `server/agent/tools_select.py`code and documentation for both objects do not provide detailed information, it can be inferred that `calculate`the function may be designed as a core mathematical calculation tool that can be called by other parts of the project to perform specific mathematical tasks. This design makes mathematical computing functions modular, making them easy to reuse and maintain in different contexts. 

**Note**:
- Make sure that this function `model_container.MODEL`is properly loaded and initialized before calling it, as this is the key to performing the calculation. 
- Since the function is used`verbose=True`, it produces a verbose log output when it is called, which is useful for debugging and analyzing the computation process, but may need to be adjusted for the actual situation in a production environment. 

**Example output**:
Assuming that you pass in `query`"2 + 2", the function might return a similar `"4"`string representing the result of the calculation. The actual return value will depend on the specific implementation and processing power of the model.

## FunctionDef shell(query)
**shell**: The function of the shell function is to execute a shell query and return the result. 

**Parameters**:
- query: The type of string that indicates the shell query command to be executed.

**Code Description**:
The shell function is defined in a `server/agent/tools/shell.py`file and is the core function used to execute shell commands in the project. The function receives a `query`string argument called the shell command that needs to be executed. Internally, the function first creates an`ShellTool` instance of the class`tool`, and then calls the methods of that instance`run` to execute the incoming `query`commands. Eventually, the function returns`run` the result of the method's execution. 

In the structure of the project, while`server/agent/tools/__init__.py` `server/agent/tools_select.py`there are no direct code examples or documentation in these two files that explain how to call`shell` a function, it can be inferred that `shell`a function, as part of a tool module, may be called by other parts of the project to execute specific shell commands. This design allows the logic to execute shell commands to be encapsulated in a separate function for easy maintenance and reuse. 

**Note**:
- When using `shell`functions, you need to make sure that incoming commands`query` are safe and avoid executing malicious code. 
- The result of this function depends on`ShellTool` how the class's `run`methods are implemented, so you need to know`ShellTool` the specifics of the implementation. 

**Example output**:
The hypothetical`ShellTool` `run`method simply returns the output of the executed command, and if called`shell("echo Hello World")`, then the possible return value is:
```
Hello World
```
## ClassDef ShellInput
**ShellInput**: The function of the ShellInput class is to define a data model for encapsulating shell commands. 

**Properties**:
- query: A string-type property that stores shell commands that can be executed on the Linux command line. The property is defined via the Field method and contains a description that this is an executable shell command.

**Code Description**:
The ShellInput class inherits from BaseModel, which indicates that it is a model based on the Pydantic library for data validation and management. In this class, a property named is defined`query`, which must be a string. By using the Field method, a `query`description of the property is provided, i.e., "a shell command that can be run on the Linux command line", which helps to understand the purpose and function of the property. 

In the context of the project, while the information currently provided does not directly show how the ShellInput class can be called by other objects, it can be inferred that the ShellInput class may be used to encapsulate user input or shell commands from other sources, which may then be executed in other parts of the project, such as the server's proxy tool. This design makes the handling of shell commands more modular and secure, as the Pydantic model provides a layer of data validation, ensuring that only legitimate and intended commands are executed.

**Note**:
- When using the ShellInput class, you need to make sure that the string you pass in `query`is a valid and secure shell command. Given the power of shell commands and their potential security risks, you should avoid executing commands from untrusted sources. 
- Since the ShellInput class is based on the Pydantic library, you need to make sure that Pydantic is installed in your project before using this class. In addition, familiarity with the basic usage of the Pydantic library and data validation mechanisms will help to make more efficient use of the ShellInput class.

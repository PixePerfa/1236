## FunctionDef search_youtube(query)
**search_youtube**: The function of this function is to search for YouTube videos based on the query string provided. 

**Parameters**:
- query: The type of string that represents the query string to be searched for on YouTube.

**Code Description**:
`search_youtube`The function accepts a parameter called `query`a string that represents the keyword or phrase that the user wants to search for on YouTube. Inside the function, an instance is first created`YouTubeSearchTool`, named`tool`. It then calls`tool` a `run`method that will be `query`passed as an input argument to the method. Eventually, the function returns`run` the result of the method's execution. 

This function is part of the project used to interact with the YouTube API, specifically `server/agent/tools`under the path. It is designed as a lightweight interface that allows other project parts, for example`server/agent/tools_select.py`, to integrate the YouTube search function by simply calling this function and passing the corresponding query string. This design makes it simple to share functionality between different project parts, while also maintaining the modularity and maintainability of the code. 

**Note**:
- Make sure that the `YouTubeSearchTool`class has been implemented correctly before calling this function, and that its `run`methods are able to accept an input argument of the type of string and return search results. 
- The performance and return result of this function is directly dependent on`YouTubeSearchTool` the implementation details of the class and the response of the YouTube API. 

**Example output**:
Assuming`YouTubeSearchTool` that `run`the method returns a list of video titles and URLs for search results, an `search_youtube`example of a possible return value for the function would be:
```python
[
    {"title": "How to search YouTube using Python", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example1"},
    {"title": "Python YouTube API Tutorial", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example2"}
]
```
This return value shows a list of two search results, each of which is a dictionary containing the title and URL of the video.
## ClassDef YoutubeInput
**YoutubeInput**: The function of the YoutubeInput class is to define an input parameter model for YouTube video searches. 

**Properties**:
- location: The query string used for video search.

**Code Description**:
The YoutubeInput class inherits from BaseModel, which indicates that it is a model class that defines data structures. In this class, a property called is defined`location` that stores the query string that the user enters when doing a YouTube video search. By using`Field` a function, a description is provided for `location`the property, "Query for Videos search", which helps to understand the purpose of the property. 

Although the use of classes is not directly mentioned in the project`server/agent/tools/__init__.py` and`server/agent/tools_select.py` the two files`YoutubeInput`, it can be inferred that `YoutubeInput`classes as a data model may be used in the process of processing YouTube video search requests. Specifically, it may be used to parse and validate the user's search request parameters to ensure that the query string passed to the YouTube API is valid and properly formatted. 

**Note**:
- When using `YoutubeInput`classes, you need to make sure that `location`the value passed to the property is a valid string, as this will directly affect the results of a YouTube video search. 
- Since `YoutubeInput`classes inherit from`BaseModel`, you can take advantage of the data validation and serialization capabilities provided by the Pydantic library to simplify the data processing process. 
- While the current documentation doesn't mention `YoutubeInput`how classes might be called in a project, developers should consider how to integrate such classes into video search and how to handle possible data validation errors.

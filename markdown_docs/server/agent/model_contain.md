## ClassDef ModelContainer
**ModelContainer**: The function of the ModelContainer class is to act as a container for models and databases. 

**Properties**:
- MODEL: USED TO STORE MODEL INSTANCES. The default value is None, which means that there is no preset model when the ModelContainer instance is created.
- DATABASE: USED TO STORE DATABASE CONNECTION INSTANCES. The default value is also None, which means that there is no preset database connection when the ModelContainer instance is created.

**Code Description**:
The ModelContainer class is a simple container class designed to store model instances and database connection instances. This class implements its function by defining two properties`MODEL`,  and  .`DATABASE` These two properties are set to Zero in the class's initialization method `__init__` , which means that neither property holds any value when an instance of the ModelContainer is created. This design allows developers to create ModelContainer instances and assign values to each of these properties as needed. 

**Note**:
- When using the ModelContainer class, developers need to be aware that the`MODEL` and `DATABASE` properties are None by default. Therefore, before attempting to access these properties or their methods, you need to make sure that they have been correctly assigned to avoid encountering `NoneType` errors where the object does not have that method. 
- The ModelContainer class provides a flexible way to manage model and database connections, but it doesn't provide any method itself to initialize `MODEL` and `DATABASE` properties. Developers need to manually assign values to these two properties according to their needs. 
- Because the ModelContainer class is relatively simple in design, it can be extended to meet the needs of the project, such as adding more properties or methods to meet more complex requirements.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: This function is used to initialize an instance of the ModelContainer class. 

**Parameters**: This function does not accept any external parameters. 

**Code Description**: When an instance of the ModelContainer class is created, the `__init__`function is automatically called. This function mainly completes the following initialization operations:
- Set the `MODEL`property to`None`. This means that after instantiation, the property is not associated with any model for the time being, and needs to be assigned according to specific needs in the future. 
- Set the `DATABASE`property to as well`None`. This indicates that in the initial phase of instantiation, the property is not associated with any database, and again needs to be associated as needed in subsequent operations. 

In this way, `__init__`the function provides a clean, clean initial state for instances of the ModelContainer class that can be easily assigned to properties and called methods. 

**Note**: 
- After you use the ModelContainer class to create an instance, you need to`MODEL` `DATABASE`assign specific models and database instances to the sum properties based on the actual situation to facilitate subsequent operations. 
- Since `MODEL`both are `DATABASE`set at initialization time`None`, it is recommended to check that they have been correctly assigned before operating on these two properties to avoid throwing errors when using uninitialized properties.

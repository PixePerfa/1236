## FunctionDef chat(query, conversation_id, history_len, history, stream, model_name, temperature, max_tokens, prompt_name)
**chat**: This function is used to implement the conversation function with the LLM model. 

**Parameters**:
- `query`: The query string entered by the user.
- `conversation_id`: Dialog ID, which identifies a dialog session.
- `history_len`: The number of historical messages taken from the database.
- `history`: A historical conversation record, which can be an integer or a list of history.
- `stream`: Whether to return the results of the conversation as a streaming output.
- `model_name`: LLM model name.
- `temperature`: LLM sampling temperature, which is used to control the randomness of the generated text.
- `max_tokens`: Limit the number of tokens generated by LLMs.
- `prompt_name`: The name of the prompt template used.

**Code Description**:
This function is primarily responsible for handling the conversation between the user and the LLM model. It first `add_message_to_db`saves the user's query and conversation information to the database via functions. Then, based on the input parameters, such as historical dialogue records, model names, temperatures, etc., an input prompt suitable for the LLM model is constructed. Next,`LLMChain` an object is used to initiate a dialog request and `AsyncIteratorCallbackHandler`the asynchronous response from the model is processed. If streaming output is enabled, the function will return the response result token by token; Otherwise, it waits for all responses to complete and returns the entire conversation at once. Finally, the`EventSourceResponse` result is returned to the client in the form of a Server Send Event (SSE). 

**Note**:
- When using `history`parameters, you can pass in a list of historical conversation records directly, or pass in an integer, and the function will read a specified number of historical messages from the database. 
- `stream`The parameter controls the output mode, and when set to True, the dialog result will be output in streaming, which is suitable for scenarios that require real-time display of the dialog process.
- `max_tokens`The parameter is used to limit the number of tokens generated by the LLM model, which helps to control the length of the generated text.

**Example output**:
Let's say the function is running in non-streaming mode and returns a simple dialog response:
```json
{
    "text": "好的，我明白了。",
    "message_id": "123456"
}
```
This means that the LLM model responds to the user's query, "Okay, I get it." and the ID of the conversation message in the database is "123456".
### FunctionDef chat_iterator
**chat_iterator**: The function of this function is to asynchronously iterate the conversation process, generating and streaming the chat response. 

**Parameters**:
- No arguments are passed directly to this function, but there are multiple externally defined variables and objects used inside the function.

**Code Description**:
`chat_iterator`is an asynchronous generator function that processes chat sessions, generates chat responses, and streams them. The function first defines an`callback` object, which is `AsyncIteratorCallbackHandler`an instance of the object, that handles callbacks for asynchronous iterations. Next, create a list of callbacks`callbacks` and `callback`add objects to it. 

By calling `add_message_to_db`the function, the function adds the chat request to the database and creates an`conversation_callback` object, which is `ConversationCallbackHandler`an instance of the object, that is used to handle the callback during the chat process and add it to the callback list. 

Adjust `max_tokens`the maximum number of tokens for generated text based on the value of ,`max_tokens` and if it is a non-positive integer, set it to`None`. 

Next, by calling `get_ChatOpenAI`a function, initialize a conversation model `model`and build a chat prompt based on the chat history (if any) or session ID (if specified).`chat_prompt` If no history or session ID is provided, the default prompt template is used. 

Then, an `LLMChain`object is created that `chain`is responsible for passing a conversation prompt to the conversation model and starting an asynchronous task that uses`wrap_done` a function-wrapped `chain.acall`call to notify you by a method when the task is completed`callback.done`. 

Finally, depending on `stream`the value of the variables, decide whether to stream each generated token or wait for all tokens to be generated and return at once. In streaming mode, `json.dumps`the generated token and message ID are encapsulated into JSON format and returned one by one. In non-streaming mode, all generated tokens are spliced and returned at one time. 

**Note**:
- `chat_iterator`Functions are asynchronous, so they need to be called with`await` keywords or in other asynchronous functions. 
- Functions use multiple externally defined variables and objects internally, such as`history` , , , etc., `max_tokens`which requires that `chat_iterator`these variables and objects must have been properly initialized and configured before they can be called. 
- Functions depend on multiple externally defined functions and classes, such as`AsyncIteratorCallbackHandler` , ,`add_message_to_db` , ,`ConversationCallbackHandler` ,`get_ChatOpenAI` , 
- When processing chat responses, the function takes into account a variety of scenarios, including whether there is a chat history, whether to get historical messages from the database, etc., which requires the caller to provide the correct parameters and configurations according to the actual situation.
- When using this function, you should pay attention to exception handling and resource management to ensure that all resources are freed at the end of the chat session.

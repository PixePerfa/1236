## FunctionDef create_controller_app(dispatch_method, log_level)
**create_controller_app**: The function of this function is to create and configure a FastAPI application to serve as a controller. 

**Parameters**:
- `dispatch_method`: String type, specifying the method by which the message is distributed.
- `log_level`: String type, default is "INFO", which is used to set the log level.

**Code Description**:
This function first imports the necessary modules and variables, including`fastchat.constants` those used to set up the log directory, as well as`fastchat.serve.controller` the imported`app` (FastAPI instance), `Controller`classes, and `logger`objects. Once the function sets the log level, it instantiates`Controller` the object and registers it with `sys.modules`the controller so that it is accessible throughout the application. 

Next, a `MakeFastAPIOffline`function is called to provide offline documentation support for the FastAPI application, which means that the Swagger UI and ReDoc documentation pages do not rely on an external CDN to load, but instead serve the required static files from locally. This step is especially important for running applications in environments where there is no external network connection. 

Finally, the function sets the title of the FastAPI app to "FastChat Controller" and takes the previously created `Controller`instance as a property of the app, so that the controller instance can be accessed directly in other parts of the app. The function returns the configured FastAPI application instance. 

**Note**:
- Make sure that the `LOG_PATH`variables are set correctly before calling this function so that the log files can be stored in the intended location. 
- `MakeFastAPIOffline`The function needs to make sure that `static_dir`the directory that the parameter points to contains all the static files required for the Swagger UI and ReDoc, including JavaScript, CSS files, icons, etc. 

**Example output**:
Since this function returns an instance of a FastAPI application, the output example will be a configured FastAPI object with set log levels, headers, controller instances, and offline documentation support. This FastAPI instance can then be used to launch web services and process HTTP requests. 
## FunctionDef create_model_worker_app(log_level)
**create_model_worker_app**: The function of this function is to create and configure a FastAPI application to act as a model worker node to support different types of model services. 

**Parameters**:
- `log_level`: String type, default is "INFO", which is used to set the level of logging.
- `**kwargs`: A keyword parameter that passes additional configuration options, including model name, controller address, minion address, and so on.

**Code Description**:
The function first imports the necessary modules and sets the log directory. Then, by parsing `kwargs`parameters, the app's behavior is dynamically set based on the configuration options provided. This includes configuration to support the Langchain model, the online API model, and the offline model. 

For models supported by Langchain, no additional configuration is required. For the online API model, you need to specify `worker_class`to create the corresponding worker node instance. For offline models, create worker node instances based on the path and device of the model, and configure various parameters of the model, such as parallel size and memory usage limit. 

In addition, the function is called `MakeFastAPIOffline`to add offline documentation support for the created FastAPI application, ensuring that the full API documentation is available even in environments without an external network connection. 

Finally, the function sets the title of the application, binds the minion instance to the application, and returns the configured FastAPI application instance.

**Note**:
- Make sure that the parameters passed to the function `kwargs`contain the correct configuration information, such as model name, controller address, etc., so that the model worker nodes are initialized correctly. 
- The FastAPI application created using this function is configured with offline document support, and you can access the API document in an offline environment without additional configuration.

**Example output**:
Since this function returns an instance of a FastAPI application, the output example will depend on the specific configuration and use case. In general, the returned FastAPI application instance can be used to start a web service and provide API interfaces such as model inference. For example, if a worker node that supports the Langchain model is configured, the returned application will provide an API interface that allows the client to perform model inference operations through HTTP requests. 
## FunctionDef create_openai_api_app(controller_address, api_keys, log_level)
**create_openai_api_app**: The function of this function is to create and configure a FastAPI application to provide OpenAI API services. 

**Parameters**:
- `controller_address`: String type, the address of the controller.
- `api_keys`: A list of strings, which is an empty list by default, is used to store API keys.
- `log_level`: String type, default is "INFO", which is used to set the log level.

**Code Description**:
First, the function `fastchat.constants.LOGDIR`sets the log directory by modifying the variables. Next, import`app` and`CORSMiddleware` `app_settings`objects for the configuration of the FastAPI application. Use `build_logger`the function to create a logger and set its log level to the parameter that was passed in`log_level`. 

The function adds a middleware to the FastAPI application `CORSMiddleware`and configures a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy that allows requests from all origins, methods, and headers. This is to ensure that different clients can interact with the API without any barriers. 

Apply`sys.modules` `logger`a custom logger to the OpenAI API server module by modifying the object. In addition,`controller_address` the corresponding properties of the object`api_keys` are assigned to `app_settings`the corresponding properties of the object, which are used to configure the controller address and API key of the API service. 

The invoking `MakeFastAPIOffline`function enables the FastAPI application to support offline documentation, which means that the Swagger UI and ReDoc documentation pages are not dependent on external CDN loading, but are served from a local server. This is especially important for running API services in environments where there is no external network connection. 

Finally, set the title of the FastAPI application to "FastChat OpenAI API Server" and return the configured FastAPI application object.

**Note**:
- Make sure that the incoming one `controller_address`is valid, as it is key for the API service to communicate with the controller. 
- When deploying an API service, you should carefully manage `api_keys`your list to avoid revealing keys for security reasons. 
- Adjusting `log_level`parameters can control the level of detail of the logs, which is helpful for debugging and monitoring the status of the API service. 

**Output example**: Since this function returns a FastAPI application object, the output example depends on the implementation of the FastAPI framework. Typically, the returned object can be used to start a web server that provides a RESTful API service. 
## FunctionDef _set_app_event(app, started_event)
**_set_app_event**: This function is used to set up startup events for FastAPI applications. 

**Parameters**:
- **app**: an instance of FastAPI, which represents the current FastAPI application. 
- **started_event**: Optional, set to None by default. It is a multiprocessing. An instance of an event that is used for cross-process communication to mark whether an app has been launched. 

**Code Description**:
This function is primarily used to register a startup event in a FastAPI application. When a FastAPI application starts, a`started_event` method is called if it is not None`started_event.set()`, which is often used to notify other processes that the application is ready in a multi-process environment. 

In a project, `_set_app_event`functions are called by several different startup functions, including`run_controller` ,`run_model_worker` ,`run_openai_api` , `run_api_server`, These startup functions are used to start different service components, such as the controller service, model worker node, OpenAI API interface, and API server. In these functions,`_set_app_event` the FastAPI application instance is passed in with an optional `started_event`parameter to ensure that the relevant startup events are set and triggered correctly when the service component starts. 

In this way, `_set_app_event`functions play an important role in the project, ensuring that the individual service components can be started in coordination in a multi-process or distributed environment, thus improving the stability and responsiveness of the system. 

**Note**:
- When using `_set_app_event`functions, you need to make sure that the parameters you pass in`app` are a valid instance of the FastAPI application. 
- If used in a multi-process environment,`started_event` the parameter should be an `multiprocessing.Event`event instance that is created to ensure proper communication across processes. 
- The function registers the startup event via the decorator, `@app.on_event("startup")`so the registered event handler will only be executed when the FastAPI application starts`on_startup`. 
### FunctionDef on_startup
**on_startup**: The function of this function is to set an event flag when the app starts. 

****Arguments: This function has no arguments. 

**Code Description**: `on_startup` A function is an asynchronous function designed to perform a specific action when an app starts. Inside the function body, it first checks whether the global variable `started_event` is  not . `None` If the condition is true, i.e., `started_event` it has already been defined and is not , `None`then  the method is called `started_event.set()` . The invocation of this method will set an event flag, which is usually used to indicate that the application has been successfully started or that an initialization process has been completed. In multithreaded or asynchronous programming, event flags are often used to synchronize different parts of the execution process to ensure that certain critical initialization steps have been completed before moving on to other operations. 

**Note**: When using this function, you need to make sure that  it `started_event` has been correctly initialized as an event object somewhere. Also, because this is an asynchronous function, you need to call it with `await` a keyword or in another asynchronous context. This ensures that asynchronous operations within the function are handled correctly. 
***
## FunctionDef run_controller(log_level, started_event)
**run_controller**: The function of this function is to start a FastAPI application that controls and manages model worker nodes. 

**Parameters**:
- `log_level`: String type, default is "INFO", which is used to set the log level.
- `started_event`: An optional parameter, which is None by default. It is a multiprocessing. An instance of an event that is used for cross-process communication to mark whether an app has been launched.

**Code Description**:
First, the function imports the necessary modules, including`uvicorn` modules for running ASGI applications,`httpx` HTTP client requests,`fastapi` request `Body`body parsing,`time` and `sys`modules. Next, the `set_httpx_config`call function sets the default timeout time and proxy configuration for the httpx library. 

A function `create_controller_app`creates a FastAPI application instance by calling a function, which is configured with a message distribution method and log level. Then, use`_set_app_event` the function to set up a startup event for the FastAPI app, and if a parameter is passed in`started_event`, mark the event when the app starts. 

A POST interface has been added to the FastAPI application `/release_worker`to release and load model worker nodes. This API receives the model name, the new model name, and the parameters of whether to keep the original model, and communicates with the model worker node to switch or release the model. 

Finally, based on the configured host address and port number, as well as the log level, use the function to start the `uvicorn.run`FastAPI application. If the log level is set to "ERROR", the standard output and error output are redirected to the system's default output and error stream. 

**Note**:
- Before starting the controller service, make sure that`FSCHAT_CONTROLLER` the sum in the dictionary`host``port`, as well as other relevant settings, are configured correctly. 
- `set_httpx_config`Functions are invoked to ensure that the requested timeout and proxy settings are in line with the project's needs when communicating with model minions.
- `/release_worker`The implementation of the interface depends on`app._controller` the object's`list_models` sum `get_worker_address`methods, which need to be `create_controller_app`properly initialized in the function. 

**Example output**:
Since this function is primarily responsible for starting the FastAPI application and does not return data directly, there is no direct output example. However, once the application is successfully launched, it will start listening on the specified host address and port number, waiting to receive HTTP requests. 
### FunctionDef release_worker(model_name, new_model_name, keep_origin)
**release_worker**: The function of this function is to release the model that is currently in use and load new models as needed. 

**Parameters**:
- `model_name`: String type, default value`Body(...)`. This parameter specifies the name of the model to be released. 
- `new_model_name`: String type, default value`None`. This parameter specifies the name of the new model to be loaded after the current model is released. 
- `keep_origin`: Boolean type, default value`False`. This parameter specifies whether the original model is retained when the new model is loaded. 

**Code Description**:
First, the function `app._controller.list_models()`gets a list of currently available models by calling it. If the specified `new_model_name`model already exists in the list of available models, the information is logged and error code 500 is returned, indicating that the model switch failed. 

If it `new_model_name`is not empty, the function will record the information that the model will start switching; If empty, the information that the model is about to be stopped is recorded. Next, check`model_name` if it is in the list of available models, if not, an error is logged and error code 500 is returned, indicating that the specified model is not available. 

The function does this by `app._controller.get_worker_address(model_name)`getting the address of the model to be released. If the address acquisition fails, the error is logged and the error code 500 is returned. 

Use the function to `get_httpx_client()`obtain the httpx client instance and send a POST request to the address of the model, including the name of the new model and the flag of whether to retain the original model. If the request status code is not 200, the model fails to be released, and an error is logged and error code 500 is returned. 

If specified`new_model_name`, the function waits for the new model to be registered. Use a loop to check whether the new model has been registered, and if the registration is successful within the timeout period, the success information is recorded and the success code 200 is returned; If the timeout is not successful, an error is logged and error code 500 is returned. 

If not specified`new_model_name`, the system records the successful release of the model and returns the success code 200. 

**Note**:
- When using this function, make sure that the model name provided is correct and that the model actually exists in the system.
- When `new_model_name`not empty, this function not only releases the specified model, but also attempts to load a new model. Therefore, you need to make sure that the new model name is correct and that the model file is ready. 
- `keep_origin`Parameters allow the original model to be retained when a new model is loaded, which is useful in scenarios where multiple models need to be run at the same time.

**Example output**:
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "msg": "sucess to release model: chatglm-6b"
}
```
Or in the event of an error:
```json
{
  "code": 500,
  "msg": "the model chatglm-6b is not available"
}
```
***
## FunctionDef run_model_worker(model_name, controller_address, log_level, q, started_event)
**run_model_worker**: The function of this function is to start a model worker node, which is used to process model inference requests. 

**Parameters**:
- `model_name`: String type, defaults to the `LLM_MODELS`first element in the list, specifying the name of the model to be launched. 
- `controller_address`: String type, which is an empty string by default, specifies the address of the controller.
- `log_level`: String type, default is "INFO", specifies the level of logging.
- `q`: Type `mp.Queue`, optional, defaults to None, a queue used for inter-process communication. 
- `started_event`: Type `mp.Event`, optional, defaults to None, which is used to mark the completion of the model worker start. 

**Code Description**:
The function first imports the necessary modules, including`uvicorn` , `fastapi`etc., and sets the configuration of the httpx library. Then, the function is called to `get_model_worker_config`obtain the configuration information of the model worker node, including the host address and port number, and`model_name` the model path and other related configurations are dynamically set. 

Next, use `create_model_worker_app`the function to create a FastAPI application instance, which is initialized based on the provided parameters and configuration information. If`log_level` set to ERROR, the standard output and error output are redirected to the system's default output and error stream. 

The function also defines an `release_model`interface that allows the currently loaded model to be released and optionally load a new model via an HTTP POST request. This interface receives the new model name and whether to keep the parameters of the original model, and`q` sends instructions to the queue to control the loading and release of the model. 

Finally, use `uvicorn.run`the function to start the FastAPI application, listen to the specified host address and port number, and provide model inference services. 

**Note**:
- Make sure that the incoming is `model_name`correctly defined in the configuration so that the correct model and configuration information is loaded. 
- If used in a multi-process environment,`q` and `started_event`parameters should be created through `multiprocessing`modules to enable proper communication between processes. 
- `controller_address`The parameter allows you to specify the address of the controller, and if it is empty, it tries to use the default controller address.

**Example output**:
Since this function is primarily responsible for starting the FastAPI application and does not return data directly, there is no direct output example. However, after the application is successfully started, the FastAPI application listens for HTTP requests on the specified host address and port number to provide model inference services. For example, if the configured host address is and`127.0.0.1` the port number is ,`8000` you can `http://127.0.0.1:8000`access the API interface of the service. 
### FunctionDef release_model(new_model_name, keep_origin)
**release_model**: The function of this function is to decide whether to keep the original model and load the new model or replace the original model based on the parameters. 

**Parameters**:
- **new_model_name**: String type, default value is None. This parameter is used to specify the name of the new model to be loaded. 
- **keep_origin**: Boolean type, default value is False. This parameter is used to specify whether to retain the original model. If true, the original model will be retained when the new model is loaded. If False, replace the original model or stop the current model. 

**Code Description**:
The function accepts two arguments:`new_model_name` and`keep_origin`. `new_model_name`Lets you specify the name of the model you want to work on, and `keep_origin`determines whether to keep or replace the original model. The internal logic of the function is as follows:
- If `keep_origin`True is true, and it is provided`new_model_name`, the model name, the "start" operation, and the new model name are placed in the queue`q` to start the new model while keeping the original model. 
- If `keep_origin`False, there are two scenarios:
  - If provided`new_model_name`, the model name, the "replace" action, and the new model name are placed in the queue`q` to replace the current model with the new model. 
  - If this is not provided`new_model_name`, the model name, stop operation, and Zero are placed in the queue`q` to stop the current model. 
- Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the status code and message of the operation result, and the status code 200 indicates that the operation is successful.

**Note**:
- Make sure that when this function is called, the queue`q` has been properly initialized and can be accessed. 
- In practical applications, the sum values need to be adjusted according to the actual situation`new_model_name` `keep_origin`to meet different model management needs. 
- The status codes and messages returned by the function can be used for further logical processing or user feedback.

**Example output**:
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "msg": "done"
}
```
This example output indicates that the operation completed successfully.
***
## FunctionDef run_openai_api(log_level, started_event)
**run_openai_api**: The function of this function is to start the OpenAI API service. 

**Parameters**:
- `log_level`: String type, default is "INFO". Lets you set the log level.
- `started_event`: An optional parameter, which is None by default. It is a multiprocessing. An instance of an event that is used for cross-process communication to mark whether a service has been started or not.

**Code Description**:
Functions first import the necessary modules, including`uvicorn` functions for running ASGI applications `sys`for system-level operations, and functions inside the project`set_httpx_config` for configuring the HTTP client. Next, the function is called`set_httpx_config` to set the configuration of the HTTP client. 

Obtain `fschat_controller_address`the address of the controller by calling a function, and then use this address and`log_level` parameters to call `create_openai_api_app`the function to create a FastAPI application instance. If a parameter is present`started_event`, `_set_app_event`this event is associated with the app instance by calling a function to mark the event when the app starts. 

Next, read `FSCHAT_OPENAI_API`the sum field of the dictionary`host` from the configuration`port`, which specifies the host address and port number of the service. If `log_level`set to "ERROR", the standard output and error output are redirected back to the system's default output and error stream, which is mainly used to reduce the verbosity of the log output. 

Finally, use the function to `uvicorn.run`start the FastAPI application and pass in the previously created application instance, host address, and port number as parameters. 

**Note**:
- Make sure that`FSCHAT_OPENAI_API` the AND fields `host`in the configuration `port`are set correctly, as they determine the network address and port of the service. 
- Using parameters in a multi-process environment`started_event` can help other processes know if the OpenAI API service is ready. 
- Tuning `log_level`parameters controls the level of detail of the log output, which helps to debug and monitor the state of the service in different environments. 
- This function is called by the function during the project's startup process`start_main_server` as part of the startup of the OpenAI API service. 
## FunctionDef run_api_server(started_event, run_mode)
Doc is waiting to be generated...
## FunctionDef run_webui(started_event, run_mode)
**run_webui**: This function is used to start the Web UI server. 

**Parameters**:
- `started_event`: A `mp.Event`parameter of type, which defaults to None. Used to synchronize between processes, to identify the Web UI server startup complete. 
- `run_mode`: A parameter of the string type, which is None by default. Special configuration for specifying the mode of operation, especially when operating in "lite" mode.

**Code Description**:
This function first imports `server.utils`the function in the module `set_httpx_config`and calls it to set the configuration of the httpx library, including the default timeout and proxy configuration. Next, the function obtains the host address and port number of the Web UI server from the global configuration. Then, build a list of command-line commands that contains all the parameters needed to start the Streamlit server, including the server address, port number, and topic-related configurations. If`run_mode` the parameter is set to "lite", additional configuration is added to the command line argument to accommodate the lightweight run mode. Finally,`subprocess.Popen` start the Streamlit process using and `started_event.set()`notify other processes that the Web UI server has been started and then wait for the process to end. 

**Note**:
- Before calling this function, you should make sure that `WEBUI_SERVER`the sum of the web UI server is correctly configured in the dictionary`host``port`. 
- This function relies on the Streamlit library to launch the web UI, so you need to make sure that Streamlit is installed in your environment.
- Parameters `run_mode`allow you to flexibly control the mode in which the web UI operates, such as using the "lite" mode in resource-constrained environments to reduce resource consumption. 
- This function is called during the startup process of the project, especially when the web UI interface needs to be launched. For example, in `start_main_server`a function, you decide whether to start a web UI server based on command-line arguments, and use an inter-process event synchronization mechanism to ensure that the web UI server is started before continuing to perform other tasks. 
## FunctionDef parse_args
**parse_args**: The function of this function is to parse the command line arguments and return the parsed arguments and parser objects. 

****Arguments: This function does not accept any arguments. 

**Code description**: `parse_args` The function uses `argparse` the library to create a parser object that parses command-line arguments. It defines multiple command-line arguments, each with its own options (e.g`-a`., , `--all-webui`etc.), actions (e.g., starting the server, specifying a model name, etc.), and a storage destination (e.g`dest="all_webui"`., ). These parameters support different modes of operation and configurations to suit different operational needs. For example, a`--all-webui` parameter launches all services, including the API and Web UI, while  a `--model-name` parameter allows the user to specify one or more model names. The function finally calls  parse `parser.parse_args()` the parameters entered by the command line and returns the parsed arguments and parser objects. 

In a project,`parse_args` a function is `start_main_server` called by a function. `start_main_server` The function `parse_args` decides which services and modes to start based on the parameters returned. For example, if a parameter is specified `--all-webui` , then `start_main_server` all services including the OpenAI API, model worker, API server, and web UI will be launched. This design makes the launch and management of services more flexible and configurable. 

**Note**: When using this function, you need to ensure that the command line arguments are correct and reasonable, as they directly affect the start and run mode of the service. In addition, considering the `argparse` use of , the environment in which this function is invoked should be a command-line interface or an environment that is compatible with command-line arguments. 

**Output example**: Assuming the command-line input is `python startup.py --all-webui` , the  objects `parse_args` that the function may return `args` will  contain properties `all_webui=True`while the other properties are set according to the defined defaults or command-line inputs. At the same time, the returned `parser` object can be used for further parameter parsing or the display of help information. 
## FunctionDef dump_server_info(after_start, args)
**dump_server_info**: The function of this function is to print server configuration and status information. 

**Parameters**:
- `after_start`: A boolean type that indicates whether this function is called after the server starts. The default value is False.
- `args`: An optional argument that contains a command-line argument object. The default value is None.

**Code Description**:
`dump_server_info` THE FUNCTION FIRST IMPORTS THE REQUIRED MODULES AND FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING THE PLATFORM INFORMATION, THE PROJECT VERSION, AND THE SERVER'S API AND WEBUI ADDRESS. Next, the function prints out the operating system, Python version, project version, and langchain and fastchat version information. In addition, the function`args` selectively prints out the currently used tokenizer, the started LLM model, and the embedded model based on the parameters passed in (if any). 

If `args`a model name is specified in the parameter, only the configuration information for that model is printed; Otherwise, print the configuration information for all LLM models. This configuration information is obtained by calling`get_model_worker_config` a function that is responsible for loading the working configuration of the specified model. 

After the server is started (i.e., `after_start`when True), the function will additionally print the server running information, including the addresses of the OpenAI API server, the Chatchat API server, and the Chatchat WEBUI server. These addresses are obtained through`fschat_openai_api_address` the ,`api_address` and `webui_address`function. 

**Note**:
- Make sure that all relevant configurations (such as project version, model configuration, and so on) are set correctly before calling this function.
- This function is mainly used to print configuration and status information to the terminal at the time of server startup or after startup, so that developers and administrators can understand the current health status of the server.
- `args`The model name in the parameters and whether to enable the API or WEBUI will affect the information content printed by the function. Therefore, when using this function, you should pass the correct parameters according to the actual situation.
## FunctionDef start_main_server
Doc is waiting to be generated...
### FunctionDef handler(signalname)
**handler**: The function of the handler function is to create and return a closure function that processes a specific signal. 

**Parameters**:
- signalname: This parameter specifies the name of the signal to be processed.

**Code Description**:
The handler function receives a parameter signalname, which is used to specify the name of the signal to be processed. Inside the function, a closure function f is defined, which takes two parameters: signal_received and frame. When the specified signal is received, the closure function throws a KeyboardInterrupt exception with a message indicating what kind of signal was received. 

It's worth noting that methods were introduced in Python version 3.9`signal.strsignal(signalnum)`, so this function may no longer be needed in that version and beyond. Similarly, Python version 3.8 introduces `signal.valid_signals()`methods that can be used to create mappings for the same purpose, further reducing the need for such custom handlers. 

**Note**:
- When using this function, you need to make sure that the signalname passed in is a valid signal name that can be captured by the program.
- Thrown KeyboardInterrupt exceptions need to be caught and handled at a higher level of the program for elegant signal processing logic.
- Due to the different versions of Python, developers should decide whether they need to use this function based on the version of Python they are using.

**Example output**:
Suppose `handler("SIGINT")`the returned closure function is called and registered as a handler for the SIGINT signal, and when the SIGINT signal is triggered, the program throws the following exception:
```
KeyboardInterrupt: SIGINT received
```
#### FunctionDef f(signal_received, frame)
**f**: The function of this function is to throw an exception when a specific signal is received`KeyboardInterrupt`. 

**Parameters**:
- `signal_received`: Received signal.
- `frame`: A reference to the current stack frame.

**Code Description**:
Functions `f`are designed to process signals sent by the operating system. When the operating system sends a signal to the Python program, the function will be called. The function takes two arguments:`signal_received` and`frame`. `signal_received`Parameters represent the received signal, while `frame`parameters are references to the current stack frames, although they are not used directly in this function body. 

The main behavior of the function is to throw an`KeyboardInterrupt` exception. This is achieved through `raise`the keyword, which is used to throw the specified exception. In this case, the exception is that `KeyboardInterrupt`this is usually used in response to the user's interrupting action, such as pressing Ctrl+C. The exception message contains a string that should`signalname` be in the form of "received", but in the provided code, `signalname`it is not defined, which may be an error or omission. The correct approach should be to specify in the exception message which signal is being received, e.g. by`signal_received` converting the value of the parameter to the corresponding signal name. 

**Note**:
- When using this function, you need to make sure that the `signal_received`parameters correctly represent the type of signal received. In addition, considering that `signalname`it is not defined in the code, the exception message needs to be corrected to correctly reflect the received signal. 
- This function is designed to elegantly interrupt a program when a specific signal is received. However, throwing exceptions`KeyboardInterrupt` can be caught and handled by the higher-level code, so this should be taken into account when designing your program. 
- Care should be taken when using signal processing functions in a multithreaded environment, as Python's signal processing is primarily performed on the main thread.

### FunctionDef process_count
**process_count**: The function of this function is to calculate the total number of current processes. 

****Arguments: This function does not accept any arguments. 

**Code Description**: The `process_count` function is designed to calculate the total number of processes currently in the system. It first obtains process information by accessing global variables `processes` . `processes` is a dictionary that contains a list of different types of processes, such as `online_api`  and `model_worker`. The function calculates `processes` the length of the dictionary, adds `online_api` the length of the list and  the `model_worker` length of the list, and then subtracts 2 to get the total number of processes. Subtracting 2 may be to adjust the number of processes that are preset or not dynamically calculated. 

**Note**: When using this function, you need to make sure that the global variable `processes` has been initialized correctly and contains `online_api` the  and `model_worker` key elements. In addition, the subtracted number 2 should be adjusted according to the actual situation to ensure the accuracy of the process count. 

**Example output**: Suppose  the `processes` dictionary contains 3 main processes, the`online_api` list contains 2 processes, and`model_worker` the list contains 3 processes, then `process_count` the return value of the function will be:

```
3 + 2 + 3 - 2 = 6
```

This means that the system currently has a total of 6 processes running.

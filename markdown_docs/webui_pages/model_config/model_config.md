## FunctionDef model_config_page(api)
**model_config_page**: This function is used to process requests for the model configuration page.

**Parameters**:
- `api`: An instance of the ApiRequest class, which is used to encapsulate HTTP requests with the API server.

**Code Description**:
The function `model_config_page` is used in the project to process requests for the model configuration page. It receives a parameter `api` of the `ApiRequest` type, which is an object that encapsulates HTTP requests and simplifies the interaction process with the API server. In this function, different API interfaces can be called through the `api` parameter to obtain or modify the model configuration. The current function body is empty, which means that the function has not yet implemented specific logic. In actual applications, developers need to add corresponding code logic to this function according to project requirements to complete the processing of model configuration page requests.

**Note**:
- When using the `model_config_page` function, you need to ensure that the `api` parameter passed in has been initialized correctly and the `base_url` attribute has pointed to the correct API server address.
- Since the current function body is empty, developers need to add implementation code according to specific needs when actually using it.
- This function is the key part of the project to process model configuration page requests, so the code should be kept clear and stable when modifying or expanding the function.

## ClassDef AliTextSplitter
**AliTextSplitter**: The function of the AliTextSplitter class is to segment text, especially for PDF documents or other texts, you can choose whether to use the document semantic segmentation model for more accurate text segmentation. 

**Properties**:
- `pdf`: Boolean, which indicates whether special processing is applied to the PDF document, defaults to False.
- `**kwargs`: Receives a variable number of keyword arguments that will be passed to the constructor of the parent class, CharacterTextSplitter.

**Code Description**:
The AliTextSplitter class inherits from the CharacterTextSplitter class and provides the ability to split text. At initialization, you can specify`pdf` whether to perform special processing on the PDF document through parameters. If `pdf`True, the text is pre-processed, including merging redundant line breaks and spaces, and removing consecutive line breaks to facilitate subsequent text segmentation. 

In `split_text`the method, the `pdf`text is first preprocessed based on the value of the parameter. Then try to import`modelscope.pipelines` the module, if the import fails, an exception will be thrown`ImportError`, prompting the user that the package needs to be installed`modelscope`. 

Use `modelscope.pipelines`the function to `pipeline`create a document segmentation task, select Model as`damo/nlp_bert_document-segmentation_chinese-base`, and specify the device as the CPU. Split `pipeline`the text by calling the object's method, and the result is a list of the split text. 

**Note**:
- Before using this class, you need to make sure that you have installed`modelscope` the package, especially if you want to do document semantic segmentation.`modelscope[nlp]` 
- The document semantic segmentation model `damo/nlp_bert_document-segmentation_chinese-base`is a Chinese document segmentation model based on BERT, which has a good segmentation effect for Chinese text. 
- In a low-configuration GPU environment, due to the large model, it is recommended to set the device to the CPU for text segmentation processing to avoid possible performance problems.

**Example output**:
```python
['这是第一段文本。', '这是第二段文本，包含多个句子。', '这是第三段文本。']
```
This output example shows `split_text`a list of split text returned by the method, with each element representing a piece of text in a document. 
### FunctionDef __init__(self, pdf)
**__init__**: The function of this function is to initialize an instance of the AliTextSplitter class. 

**Parameters**:
- `pdf`: A Boolean value to specify whether to process PDF files, the default value is False.
- `**kwargs`: Receives a variable number of keyword arguments that will be passed to the initialization method of the parent class.

**Code Description**:
This initialization function is the `AliTextSplitter`constructor of the class and is used to set the initial state when an instance of the class is created. It accepts a parameter named`pdf` and multiple keyword arguments`**kwargs`. `pdf`The parameter is used to indicate `AliTextSplitter`whether the instance will be used to process PDF files, and its default value is False, which means that PDF files will not be processed by default. If you need to process PDF files,`AliTextSplitter` set this parameter to True when you create an instance. 

In addition, via `**kwargs`parameters, this function supports receiving additional keyword arguments that are not directly declared in the function definition. These additional parameters are`super().__init__(**kwargs)` passed to the initialization method of the parent class via a statement. This design allows classes the`AliTextSplitter` flexibility to extend or modify the behavior of their parent class without modifying its constructor signature. 

**Note**:
- When using `AliTextSplitter`classes, you should decide whether to set the parameter to True based on your actual needs`pdf`. If you need to process PDF files in your application scenario, you should set this parameter to True. 
- Passing arguments `**kwargs`to the parent class should be compatible with the parent class's initialization method and avoid passing invalid or irrelevant arguments that could throw errors.

### FunctionDef split_text(self, text)
**split_text**: The function of this function is to perform semantic segmentation of the text. 

**Parameters**:
- text: The text that needs to be segmented, and the data type is a string (str).

**Code Description**:
`split_text`Functions are primarily used to semantically segment a given text. It first checks for the presence `self.pdf`of attributes, and if so, preprocesses the text, including merging too many line breaks, replacing all whitespace characters with a single space, and removing consecutive line breaks. The purpose of this step is to clean up common formatting issues in PDF documents so that they can be split later. 

Next, the function attempts to import`modelscope.pipelines` a module, which provides a `pipeline`function for loading and executing a specific NLP task. If the import fails, an exception will be thrown`ImportError` to prompt the user that the package needs to be installed`modelscope`. 

After a successful import`modelscope.pipelines`, the function uses the `pipeline`function to create a document segmentation task, specifies the model to be used`damo/nlp_bert_document-segmentation_chinese-base`, and sets the compute device to CPU. This model is based on BERT, which is open sourced by Alibaba DAMO Academy and is specifically used for semantic segmentation of Chinese documents. 

Finally, the function passes the input text to the model for segmentation, and returns the segmentation result (a list of the segmented text). The segmentation result is obtained by splitting the text output by the model and`\n\t` filtering out empty strings. 

**Note**:
- Before using this function, you need to make sure that the package is installed`modelscope[nlp]`. It can be installed by executing`pip install "modelscope[nlp]" -f https://modelscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/releases/repo.html`. 
- Since the BERT-based model is used for document segmentation, there are certain requirements for computing resources. By default, the model runs on the CPU, but if there are enough GPU resources, the calculations can be accelerated by modifying`device` the parameters. 

**Example output**:
```python
['欢迎使用文档分割功能', '这是第二段文本', '这是第三段文本']
```
This output example shows the `split_text`result of a function processing where the input text is split into three segments, each of which is returned as an element of the list.

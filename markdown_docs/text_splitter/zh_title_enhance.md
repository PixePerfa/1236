## FunctionDef under_non_alpha_ratio(text, threshold)
**under_non_alpha_ratio**: This function is used to check if the proportion of non-alphabetic characters in a text fragment exceeds a given threshold. 

**Parameters**:
- text: The input string that needs to be tested.
- threshold: If the proportion of non-alphabetic characters exceeds this threshold, the function returns False.

**Code Description**:
`under_non_alpha_ratio`Functions are primarily used to filter out strings that may be incorrectly marked as title or narrative text, such as strings that contain a lot of non-alphabetic characters such as "-----------BREAK---------". This function determines whether the proportion of non-whitespace and letter-filled characters in the input text to the total number of non-whitespace characters determines whether the proportion is below a given threshold. If it is, it is considered that the proportion of non-alphabetic characters in the text is too high, and the function returns False. It is important to note that the whitespace character is ignored when calculating the total number of characters. 

In a project, `under_non_alpha_ratio`functions are called by `is_possible_title`functions to determine whether a piece of text is likely to be a valid title. `is_possible_title`The function uses a series of rules, such as the length of the text, whether there is punctuation at the end of the text, the proportion of non-alphabetic characters in the text, and so on. In this process, the `under_non_alpha_ratio`function is responsible for checking whether the proportion of non-alphabetic characters in the text exceeds the set threshold (0.5 by default), which is one of the important conditions for judging whether the text is likely to be a title. 

**Note**:
- If the input text is empty, or if any exception occurs while calculating the scale (e.g. divided by zero), the function will return False.
- The threshold parameter of the function is configurable and can be adjusted according to the actual situation, and the default value is 0.5.

**Example output**:
Suppose there is a text`"Hello, World!"`, and the call `under_non_alpha_ratio("Hello, World!")`will return False because the proportion of alphabetic characters in that text is higher than the default threshold of 0.5. For text`"-----BREAK-----"`, the call `under_non_alpha_ratio("-----BREAK-----")`may return True because the proportion of non-alphabetic characters exceeds the threshold. 
## FunctionDef is_possible_title(text, title_max_word_length, non_alpha_threshold)
**is_possible_title**: This function is used to check if the text meets all the criteria to be a valid title. 

**Parameters**:
- text: The input text to check.
- title_max_word_length: The maximum number of words a title can contain, default is 20.
- non_alpha_threshold: The text is considered to be the minimum alphabetic character ratio required for the title, which defaults to 0.5.

**Code Description**:
`is_possible_title`The function uses a series of conditions to determine whether a given text is likely to be a valid title. First of all, if the text length is 0, that is, the text is empty, then False is returned directly, indicating that it is not a title. Secondly, if the text ends with punctuation, it is also considered not a title. In addition, if the length of the text exceeds the set maximum number of words (20 by default), or if the proportion of non-alphabetic characters in the text exceeds the set threshold (checked by calling`under_non_alpha_ratio` the function), it is also considered not a title. The function also checks whether the text ends with a comma, period, or if the text is all numbers, in which case the text is not considered a title. Finally, the function checks if there are numbers in the first 5 characters of the text, and if they don't, it is considered not a heading. 

**Note**:
- A regular expression is used in the function to check if the text ends with punctuation, which is a condition for determining whether the text is likely to be the title.
- When determining whether the length of a text exceeds the maximum number of words, it is simply based on spaces instead of using complex word segmentation methods for performance reasons.
- `under_non_alpha_ratio`Functions are used to calculate the proportion of non-alphabetic characters in text to help determine if the text is likely to be a title.

**Example output**:
Suppose there is a text`"这是一个可能的标题"`, and the call `is_possible_title("这是一个可能的标题")`will return True because that text satisfies all the conditions to be a header. For text`"这不是标题。"`, the call `is_possible_title("这不是标题。")`returns False because it ends with punctuation. 
## FunctionDef zh_title_enhance(docs)
**zh_title_enhance**: The function of this function is to enhance the title in the document set and annotate the content of subsequent documents accordingly. 

**Parameters**:
- docs: A Document object that represents the set of documents that need to be processed.

**Code Description**:
`zh_title_enhance`The function first checks if the incoming document set `docs`is empty. If it's not empty, it iterates through each document, using`is_possible_title` a function to determine if the current document `page_content`is likely to be a valid title. If so, it will set the current document's`metadata` in `category`settings `'cn_Title'`and save the document's `page_content`as a title. For subsequent documents, if a title has been found, it `page_content`adds a paragraph of text to the front of the document stating that the part is related to the previously found title. If the incoming dossier is empty, a "File does not exist" prompt is printed. 

**Note**:
- This function relies on `is_possible_title`a function to determine whether a document content can be used as a title. `is_possible_title`Functions determine whether a text is likely to be a title based on its characteristics, such as length, punctuation ends, numeric proportions, and so on. 
- The function modifies the incoming Document object, adds metadata tags to possible title documents, and modifies the contents of subsequent documents to reflect their relationship to the found title.
- If the document set is empty, the function does nothing and only prints the prompt.

**Example output**:
Suppose the incoming document set contains two documents, the first document has `page_content`a valid title and the second document is the body content. Once processed, the first document's will`metadata` be included`{'category': 'cn_Title'}`, while the second document's `page_content`will be modified to read "The following is related to (valid titles)." Original body content".

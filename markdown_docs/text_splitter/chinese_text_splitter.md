## ClassDef ChineseTextSplitter
**ChineseTextSplitter**: This class function is to process sentences for Chinese text, especially optimized for PDF text processing and long sentence splitting. 

**Properties**:
- `pdf`: Boolean, which indicates whether special processing is applied to PDF text, defaults to False.
- `sentence_size`: An integer that defines the maximum length of a sentence, beyond which sentences will be further divided, with a default value of 250.

**Code Description**:
The ChineseTextSplitter class inherits from CharacterTextSplitter and is specifically designed to process clauses for Chinese text. It provides two main methods:`split_text1` AND `split_text`for different clause logic. 

- `split_text1`The method mainly deals with PDF text, removes redundant line breaks and spaces through regular expressions, and then uses specific clause symbols for clause segmentation. This method is suitable for simple sentence requirements.
- `split_text`The method provides a more complex clause logic, which not only deals with the special format of the PDF text, but also performs detailed segmentation of long sentences. It starts with a preliminary clause using punctuation, and then further splits sentences that exceed`sentence_size` the length defined by the attribute to ensure that the length of each sentence does not exceed the set maximum. 

Together, these two methods support efficient and flexible sentence processing of Chinese text, especially when dealing with text and long sentences from PDF sources, showing good adaptability and precision.

**Note**:
- When using `split_text`methods for text segmentation, you should pay attention to `sentence_size`the setting of attributes to avoid sentences that are too long or too short from affecting subsequent processing. 
- For PDF text, it is recommended to enable `pdf`attributes for better sentence segmentation. 
- The clause rules of this class are mainly based on Chinese punctuation marks, and may require additional adjustments for processing that contains a large amount of English or other specially formatted text.

**Example output**:
```python
splitter = ChineseTextSplitter(pdf=True, sentence_size=250)
text = "这是一个测试文本。这个文本包含多个句子，用于测试。"
result = splitter.split_text(text)
print(result)
```
Let's assume the output is:
```python
["这是一个测试文本。", "这个文本包含多个句子，用于测试。"]
```
This example shows how to use `ChineseTextSplitter`a class to split a text with two sentences to get a list of sentences as output. 
### FunctionDef __init__(self, pdf, sentence_size)
**__init__**: This function is used to initialize an instance of the ChineseTextSplitter class. 

**Parameters**:
- `pdf`: A boolean value that specifies whether to process PDF files, defaulting to False.
- `sentence_size`: An integer that specifies the maximum length of a sentence, defaulting to 250.
- `**kwargs`: Receives a variable number of keyword arguments that will be passed to the initialization method of the parent class.

**Code Description**:
`__init__`The method is the constructor of the ChineseTextSplitter class, which is used to initialize the properties of an instance of the class when it is created. It receives three parameters:`pdf` , `sentence_size`, and`**kwargs` . `pdf`The default value is False, which indicates that PDF files are not processed by default. `sentence_size`The parameter is used to specify the maximum length of each sentence when splitting text, and the default value is 250 characters. `**kwargs`is a variable-keyword argument that allows the constructor to pass additional parameters to the parent class, which is useful in the inheritance system of classes to ensure that the parent class is also initialized correctly. 

In the method body, the `super().__init__(**kwargs)`initialization logic of the parent class is first ensured by calling the constructor of the parent class. Then,`pdf` the values `sentence_size`of the sum parameter are assigned to the instance variables`self.pdf` and `self.sentence_size`so that they can be accessed through these instance variables in other methods of the class. 

**Note**:
- When using the ChineseTextSplitter class, the settings and parameters should be based on actual requirements`pdf``sentence_size`. If you need to process a PDF file, you should set the`pdf` parameter to True. 
- `sentence_size`The parameters should be adjusted according to the characteristics and processing needs of the target text to achieve the best text segmentation effect.
- Parameters passed to `**kwargs`the parent class should be compatible with the constructor of the parent class to avoid passing invalid or incorrect arguments.

### FunctionDef split_text1(self, text)
**split_text1**: The function of this function is to sentence Chinese text. 

**Parameters**:
- `text`: Text that needs to be processed in a clause, of type string.

**Code Description**:
`split_text1` The function first checks if the object has a `pdf` property. If so, it preprocesses the text, including replacing three or more consecutive line breaks with a single line break, replacing all whitespace characters with a single space, and removing two consecutive line breaks. These preprocessing steps are designed to simplify the structure of the text in preparation for clauses. 

Next, the function uses regular expressions to define a clause pattern `sent_sep_pattern`that recognizes sentence end flags in Chinese text, including common Chinese punctuation marks (such as periods, question marks, exclamation marks, etc.) and quotation marks that may follow. This pattern is at the heart of the clause, and it accurately identifies the boundaries of the sentence. 

The function then `sent_sep_pattern.split(text)` splits the text into multiple fragments via the method. It then iterates through the fragments, deciding whether to add the fragment to a new sentence or stand on its own as a new sentence based on whether the fragment matches the sentence pattern. This process eventually generates a list of sentences `sent_list`that contain all the individual sentences in the text. 

**Note**:
- This function assumes that the input text is Chinese, and sentences are processed specifically for Chinese punctuation. If the text you enter is not Chinese, or if you use non-Chinese punctuation, the sentence may not work as well as it should.
- The sentence effect of a function is `sent_sep_pattern` affected by the accuracy of the regular expression, and you may need to adjust the regular expression to the specific text content to achieve the best results. 

**Example output**:
Let's say the input text is: "The weather is so nice today." Let's go to the park and play! Do you agree? ", the return value of the function may be as follows:
```python
["今天天气真好。", "我们去公园玩吧！", "你同意吗？"]
```
This example shows how to split text containing multiple sentences into separate sentence lists, with each sentence acting as an element of the list.

### FunctionDef split_text(self, text)
**split_text**: The function of this function is to split the text into a list of sentences. 

**Parameters**:
- `text`: The text that needs to be segmented, of type string.

**Code Description**:
This function first checks for the presence `pdf`of attributes, and if so, preprocesses the text, including merging redundant line breaks, replacing all whitespace characters with a single space, and removing consecutive line breaks. Next, the function uses a regular expression to sentence the text. This includes dealing with single-character sentence breakers (such as periods, question marks, etc.), ellipsis in English and Chinese, and considering terminators after double quotation marks as the end of sentences. In addition, if there are extra line breaks at the end of the paragraph, they will also be removed. 

For text that exceeds the set sentence length (`self.sentence_size`), the function further refines the segmentation logic, including splitting the text after commas and periods, and handling consecutive spaces or line breaks. This process may be done recursively to ensure that no individual sentence exceeds the set length limit. 

Finally, the function returns a list of all the sentences that have been split, and each sentence is not empty and does not exceed the set sentence size.

**Note**:
- The clause logic of the function is mainly based on the characteristics of Chinese text, but it is also suitable for text containing punctuation such as English periods and commas.
- For specially formatted text, such as text in PDF documents, you may need to preprocess it first to optimize the sentence separation effect.
- The precision of a clause is affected by the design of the regular expression, and you may need to adjust the regular expression to the actual text content to achieve the best results.

**Example output**:
Let's say `self.sentence_size`it's set to 100, for input text:
```
"这是第一句。这是第二句，包含，逗号。这是一个超过设定长度的句子，因此需要被进一步分割。"
```
A function might return a list like this:
```
["这是第一句。", "这是第二句，包含，逗号。", "这是一个超过设定长度的句子，", "因此需要被进一步分割。"]
```

## FunctionDef get_ocr(use_cuda)
**get_ocr**: The function of this function is to get an OCR object that is used to perform text recognition in an image or PDF. 

**Parameters**:
- use_cuda: Boolean value, specifies whether to use CUDA acceleration. Defaults to True.

**Code Description**:
`get_ocr`Functions are designed to provide a flexible way to get a functional object for Character Recognition (OCR). It first tries to`rapidocr_paddle` import `RapidOCR`classes from the module, and if successful, an instance is created`RapidOCR` where the CUDA acceleration settings will be decided based on the`use_cuda` parameters. If an exception occurs when trying to import`rapidocr_paddle``ImportError`, indicating that the corresponding package may not be installed, the function attempts to import the class from`rapidocr_onnxruntime` the module `RapidOCR`and creates an instance that does not specify CUDA acceleration`RapidOCR`. This design allows the function to work flexibly in different environment configurations, providing OCR services as much as possible even in the absence of certain dependencies. 

In the project, `get_ocr`functions are used in different scenarios to perform OCR tasks. For example, in`document_loaders/myimgloader.py` `img2text`the method, it is used to recognize text in an image file; `document_loaders/mypdfloader.py``pdf2text`In this case, it is used to recognize text in PDF files as well as text embedded in images in PDFs. This shows `get_ocr`the versatility and importance of functions in a project, providing a unified OCR solution for working with different types of documents. 

**Note**:
- When using `get_ocr`functions, you need to make sure that at least`rapidocr_paddle` `rapidocr_onnxruntime`one package is installed in or so that the function can successfully return an OCR object. 
- If you plan to use it in an environment that does not have CUDA support, you should set the`use_cuda` parameter to False to avoid unnecessary errors. 

**Example output**:
Since `get_ocr`the function returns an `RapidOCR`object, the output example will depend on the specific implementation of that object. In general, it can be expected that this object provides a way to perform OCR tasks, such as recognizing text in an image or PDF, and returning the recognition result.

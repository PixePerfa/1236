## ClassDef RapidOCRPDFLoader
**RapidOCRPDFLoader**: The function of RapidOCRPDFLoader is to extract text and image content from PDF files, and convert image content to text through OCR technology. 

**Properties**:
- There are no specific public properties, and the class mainly implements functionality through methods.

**Code Description**:
The RapidOCRPDFLoader class inherits from UnstructuredFileLoader and is specifically designed to handle the loading and content extraction of PDF files. This class realizes the function of `_get_elements`extracting text and pictures from PDF through defined methods, and can process the rotation and OCR recognition of images, and finally structure the recognized text content. 

In the`_get_elements` method, a `rotate_img`function is defined to handle image rotation, and then a `pdf2text`function is defined to extract the text and image content from the PDF file. `pdf2text`The function uses the fitz library (pyMuPDF) to open and process PDF files, and extracts page text and image information by traversing each page. For image content, first check whether the image size exceeds the set threshold, then decide whether you need to rotate the image according to the rotation angle of the page, and finally use OCR technology to convert the image content to text. 

This type of use case is that you need to extract text information from PDF files, and you also need to process the content of images in PDFs, especially if the images contain important text information. Through OCR technology, the text information in these pictures can be converted into a readable text format, further enhancing the accuracy and completeness of text extraction.

**Note**:
- Before using the RapidOCRPDFLoader class, you need to make sure that you have installed the fitz (pyMuPDF) library and the OpenCV library, as these two libraries are key to handling PDF files and image rotation.
- The accuracy of OCR technology is affected by the quality of the image, so the results of OCR may be less than ideal when dealing with highly compressed or low-quality images.
- This type of file may consume a lot of computing resources when processing large PDF files, so you need to be careful when using it in resource-constrained environments.

**Example output**:
Assuming that a PDF file containing text and images is processed, RapidOCRPDFLoader may return the text content in the following format:
```
The text content of the first page...
The text content recognized by image 1...
The text content recognized by image 2...
The text content of the second page...
The text content recognized by image 3...
...
```
This output example shows how RapidOCRPDFLoader combines text and image content in a PDF file to provide a continuous stream of text for subsequent processing and analysis.
### FunctionDef _get_elements(self)
**_get_elements**: The function of this function is to extract the text and image content from the PDF file, perform OCR recognition on the image, and finally structure the recognized text content. 

**Arguments**: This function has no direct arguments, it accesses member variables through an instance of the class. 

**Code Description**:
- `_get_elements` The function first defines two intrinsic functions:`rotate_img` and `pdf2text`. 
- `rotate_img` The function is used to rotate the image, accepting the image and rotation angle as parameters, and returning the rotated image. It calculates the rotation matrix through the OpenCV library and applies it to the input image to obtain the rotated image.
- `pdf2text` The function is responsible for converting the contents of the PDF file to text. It uses a `fitz`library (i.e., PyMuPDF) to open a PDF file, iterate through each page, extract text content, and use a progress bar (`tqdm`library) to show the progress of processing. For the image on each page, if the size of the image exceeds the set threshold (`PDF_OCR_THRESHOLD`), the text in the image is recognized using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology. If there is rotation on the page, the image is rotated and corrected first, and then OCR recognition is performed. 
- After extracting the text and image content of all pages, the`_get_elements` function uses `partition_text`the function to structure the extracted text for subsequent data processing and analysis. 

**Note**:
- This function relies on OpenCV and PyMuPDF libraries for image processing and PDF file reading, and you need to ensure that these libraries are installed and configured correctly.
- The accuracy of OCR recognition is affected by the image quality, and the clarity of the image and the accuracy of rotation correction have an important impact on the recognition results.
- The variables used in the function `PDF_OCR_THRESHOLD`need to be adjusted according to the actual situation to optimize the effect and performance of OCR recognition. 

**Example output**:
Since `_get_elements`the output of the function depends on the content of the input PDF file and the result of OCR recognition, it is not possible to provide a fixed output example. Typically, the function returns a list of structured text content, with each element in the list representing a piece of text content in the PDF that has been OCR identified and structured. 
#### FunctionDef rotate_img(img, angle)
**rotate_img**: The function of this function is to rotate the image. 

**Parameters**:
- img: Image to be rotated.
- angle: The angle of rotation, with positive values indicating counterclockwise rotation and negative values indicating clockwise rotation.

**Code Description**:
`rotate_img` The function takes an image and a rotation angle as input and returns the rotated image. First, it calculates the height and width of the image, and then determines the center of rotation, which is the center point of the image. Next, `cv2.getRotationMatrix2D` use the method to get the rotation matrix, which takes the center of rotation, the angle of rotation, and the scale (in this case, 1.0, which means keeping the original size) as inputs. Then, calculate the new boundaries of the rotated image to ensure that no part of the rotated image is lost. Finally, by adjusting the translation parameters in the rotation matrix, the `cv2.warpAffine` rotation matrix is applied using the method to obtain the rotated image and return. 

In a project, a`rotate_img` function is called by  a `pdf2text` function to process images in a PDF document. When the PDF page has a rotation angle, the`pdf2text` function extracts the image in the page, and then calls  the function `rotate_img` to rotate the image back to the normal orientation for subsequent OCR (Optical Character Recognition) processing. This ensures the accuracy of OCR processing, especially when dealing with scanned documents and image-intensive PDF files. 

**Note**:
- When using `cv2.getRotationMatrix2D` the  and `cv2.warpAffine` methods, you need to make sure that you have imported the OpenCV library (i.e. cv2). 
- Rotating an image may cause part of the edge of the image to be cropped. Therefore, calculating the new boundaries and adjusting the panning parameters are critical steps to ensure image integrity.

**Example output**:
Suppose there is an image `img` and rotation angle `angle=90`, `rotate_img(img, 90)` and when called, a new image is returned, where the original image has been rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.

#### FunctionDef pdf2text(filepath)
**pdf2text**: The function of this function is to convert the text and image content in the PDF file into text format. 

**Parameters**:
- filepath: The path to the PDF file.

**Code Description**:
`pdf2text` The function first imports the necessary libraries, including`fitz` (for processing PDF files) and `numpy`(for processing image data). Then, it calls the `get_ocr`function to obtain the OCR object for subsequent image text recognition. By opening a PDF file with a specified path, the function traverses each page, extracts`fitz` the text content on the page using the library, and adds it up into the response string. 

For each image on the page, the function `get_image_info`obtains the image information by method and checks whether the size of each image exceeds a preset threshold (`PDF_OCR_THRESHOLD`). If the image size is appropriate, the function will use the `fitz.Pixmap`Read Image data. If the page has a rotation angle, the function will call `rotate_img`the function to rotate the image back to the normal orientation to ensure the accuracy of the OCR. Subsequently, the OCR object is used to perform text recognition on the image, and the recognition result is added to the response string. 

Throughout the process, `tqdm`the library is used to display the progress of the process, providing users with friendly feedback on the progress. 

**Note**:
- Make sure that`fitz` libraries are installed (i.e`PyMuPDF`., ),`numpy` , ,`tqdm` etc. 
- `PDF_OCR_THRESHOLD`is a preset threshold that determines which images need to be OCR. This threshold needs to be adjusted based on the actual situation.
- Function dependencies`get_ocr` and `rotate_img`two functions, ensuring that these dependencies are implemented correctly and available. 
- Since OCR processing can be time-consuming, it may take a long time to execute this function for PDF files that contain a large number of images.

**Example output**:
When the function is called`pdf2text(filepath)`, a string is returned that contains the text content of all the pages in the PDF file, as well as the text in the image recognized by OCR. For example, if a PDF file contains the text "Welcome to OCR" and an image with the text "Image Recognition", the function will return a string containing "Welcome to OCR\nImage Recognition".
